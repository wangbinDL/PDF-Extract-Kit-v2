#### Abstract

Background: $\beta$-thalassaemia major is one of the chronic hemolytic anemias resulting from defect in $\beta$-globin chain. It requires frequent blood transfusion plus other treatment modalities. These treatment modalities may be associated with certain immunologic modulations. Objective: To assess the immunity status in children with $\beta$-thalassaemia major under different treatment regimens within El Minia, Egypt. Subjects and Methods: One hundred forty-four children were enrolled and classified into four groups. Thirty-six $\beta$-thalassaemia patients treated only with blood transfusion (group I). Thirty-six patients treated with transfusion and iron chelation (group II). Thirty-six patients treated with transfusion, iron chelation and subjected to splenectomy (group III). Group IV involved thirty-six apparently healthy age and sex matched children. CBC plus serum levels of ferritin, IgA, complement C3 and C4 were measured along with detection of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD56+ lymphocyte percentages and absolute counts. Results: IgA levels were significantly higher in thalassaemia patients compared to controls ( $p<0.001$ ) plus highly significant increase in IgA levels in splenectomized patients than non-splenectomized ( $\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ). Levels of C3 were significantly decreased in all patients compared with controls ( $p=0.001$ ) with a highly significant decrease in C3 levels in splenectomized patients than non splenectomized ones ( $\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) but no statistical difference between their C4 levels. Significant statistical differences were revealed regarding CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte percentages within thalassaemia groups when compared to each other's and to controls. Splenectomized patients had higher significant levels regarding serum ferritin ( $\mathrm{p}=0.02$ ) along with CD3+ $(\mathrm{p}=0.05$ ), CD4+ $(\mathrm{p}=0.05$ ) and CD8+ ( $\mathrm{p}=0.037$ ) lymphocyte percentages compared to non-splenectomized. CD19+ lymphocyte percentages were significantly higher while CD56+ lymphocyte percentages were significantly lower in all patients compared with controls ( $\mathrm{p}=0.02$ and 0.05 ). Conclusion: Immune modulation occurs in thalassaemia patients with regional specific variations and is related to variations in treatment modalities.

## Introduction

Thalassaemia is defined as a group of inherited disorders that arise as a result of certain mutations in hemoglobin ( Hb ) genes. $\beta$ thalassaemia major ( $\beta \mathrm{TM}$ ) has a high prevalence in the Mediterranean region, including Egypt, Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and South East Asia [1]. Though, it is a growing global health problem due to extensive population migrations. About $1.5 \%$ of the world populations are carriers of $\beta$-thalassaemia gene [2]. $\beta \mathrm{TM}$ patients present with many problems rather than severe anemia, including increased susceptibility to infections which constitutes the second most common cause of mortality and a major cause of morbidity in $\beta$-thalassaemia after heart failure [3]. The underlying causes of their increased liability to infections may be attributed to anemia per-se, reticuloendothelial system dysfunction as well as therapeutic regimens-related infections [4].

These therapeutic approaches incorporate repeated blood transfusion alone or in combination with iron chelators. Splenectomy is added when indicated. Recently, gene therapy and bone marrow transplant or stem cell therapy are promising hopes [5]. Volumetric



USA). B-Lymphocyte subsets in whole blood samples were enumerated using phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated CD19 (Becton Dickinson, Bioscience, USA). Natural killer Lymphocyte subsets in whole blood samples were enumerated using phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated CD56 (Becton Dickinson, Bioscience, USA). Flow cytometric analysis was done by FACS Calibur flow cytometry with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, USA). An isotype matched negative control was used with each sample. Forward and side scatter histogram was used to define the lymphocyte population (R1). The absolute counts and percentages of CD3, 4, 8, 19 and 56 subsets of lymphocytes were calculated.

## Statistical analysis

The clinical and laboratory data were recorded. These data were analyzed using statistical program for social science SPSS software version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative variables were presented as mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD). On the other hand, description of qualitative variables was presented as number (No.) and percentage (\%). Results were expressed as tables and figures. Graphics were done by Excel, Microsoft Office 2010. Student $t$-test was used to compare results between groups as regards quantitative variables. The correlation was performed by using Pearson correlation coefficient $(r)$. For all tests, a probability $(\mathrm{p})$ was considered non-significant if $>0.05$, significant if $\leq 0.05$ and highly significant if $\leq 0.001$. One Way ANOVA test was used for comparison of quantitative data between more than two groups. The Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables between groups.

## Results

Comparison of laboratory results and immunological parameters between $\beta$-thalassaemia major children under different treatment modalities and controls
A significant difference was found on comparison between all thalassaemia patients (group I, II, III) and control group regarding Hb levels $(p=0.015)$, ANC $(p=0.05)$, serum $\operatorname{Ig} A(p<0.001)$, serum C3 $(p=0.001)$, serum C4 $(p=0.002)$, CD3+ absolute count $(p=0.05)$, CD3+/CD4+ absolute count $(p=0.04)$, CD3+/CD8+ absolute count ( $p=0.06)$, CD19+ absolute count ( $p=0.02$ ) and CD56+ absolute count ( $p=0.05$ ) (Table 1).
Also, differences within the 3 thalassaemia groups regarding IgA, C3, C4 (Table 2) along with percents of CD3+, CD3+/CD4+, CD3+/CD8+, CD19+ and CD56+ as well as their absolute counts were summarized (Figure 1 and Table 2).

The comparison between splenectomized patients (group III) and non splenectomized ones (group I plus II) concerning the studied immune parameters was illustrated in Figure 1. Serum IgA levels were statistically significant high in splenectomized patients compared with non splenectomized groups ( $\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) (Figure 2A). Moreover, splenectomized patients showed significant decrease in serum C3 levels $(\mathrm{p}<0.001)$ and non-significant difference in serum C4 levels in comparison to non splenectomized groups $(p=0.282)$ (Figure 2B). CD3+, 4+ and 8+ percentages were statistically significant higher in the splenectomized group in comparison to non splenectomized patients ( $p=0.05,0.05$ and 0.037 respectively). On the other hand, splenectomized children showed non-significant difference from non splenectomized ones concerning CD19+ percentage, but highly statistically significant lower levels regarding CD56+ ( $\mathrm{p}=0.235,<0.001$ respectively) (Figure 2C).

Serum ferritin levels within $\beta$-thalassaemia subgroups in correlation to immunological characteristics
The mean $\pm$ SD of serum ferritin levels within thalassaemia groups as well as controls were shown in table 1. There was a significant increase in serum ferritin levels when patients were compared with controls ( $p=0.013$ ). Additionally, serum ferritin levels were elevated in splenectomized patients (group III) compared with non splenectomized ones $(\mathrm{p}=0.02)$ (Figure 3). Significant moderate positive correlation was found between CD3+ cells and ferritin ( $\mathrm{p}=0.04, \mathrm{r}=0.6$ ). As well, significant fair positive correlation was found between CD3+/CD8+ cells and ferritin ( $\mathrm{p}=0.04, \mathrm{r}=0.3$ ) in group I. There were no other significant correlations between ferritin and the remaining immune parameters (Table 3).
