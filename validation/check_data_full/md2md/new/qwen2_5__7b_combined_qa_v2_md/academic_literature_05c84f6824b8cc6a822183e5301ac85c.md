#### Abstract

We describe a case of coronary artery perforation in a 76 -year-old man, successfully treated by tris-acryl gelatin microsphere embolisation. This novel interventional embolic material is used in interventional radiology for arterial embolisation. We believe that this is the first report of its use for a coronary artery perforation.

## Introduction

Coronary artery perforation during percutaneous interventions is relatively rare but associated with a high incidence of cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction and death. ${ }^{1.2}$ While improvements in procedural technique and equipment have reduced the incidence in routine cases, many complex cases with a higher risk of complications are now being treated percutaneously. ${ }^{1}$ Percutaneous management strategies for coronary perforation include prolonged balloon inflation, deployment of covered stents and arterial embolisation. ${ }^{3,4}$ We report a case of perforation managed successfully with tris-acryl gelatin microspheres embolisation.

## Case Presentation

A 76-year-old man presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (peak troponin-T $8.37 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$ [normal $<0.03])$. He was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, a beta-blocker, an ACE-inhibitor and a statin. He was enrolled in the EARLY-ACS [Early glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in non-ST-segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome] trial, ${ }^{5}$ receiving either intravenous eptifabatide or placebo. Coronary angiography showed a chronic occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery ( Cx ) with TIMI-I flow, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis and mild right coronary artery disease (Fig. 1a).

After administration of 8000 units of heparin, the mid-LAD stenosis was uneventfully treated using a paclitaxel-eluting stent. The Cx lesion was crossed with a High Torgue Intermediate guidewire (Guidant, Santa Clara, CA) that appeared to move freely in the expected course of the distal LCx. After pre-dilatation with a 1.25 mm balloon, limited extravasation of contrast from the mid-Cx into the pericardium (type 2 perforation ${ }^{2}$ ) was

detected (Fig. 1b). Percutaneous intervention was aborted but the trial medication (eptifibatide or placebo) was continued. The patient returned to the ward pain-free and haemodynamically stable.

Two hours later, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly with reduced level of consciousness and no recordable blood pressure. His trial medication was discontinued. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis drained 320 ml of blood, leading to immediate clinical improvement with return of systolic blood pressure to 130 mmHg . He did not require intubation.

Repeat angiography demonstrated continuous flow of contrast into the pericardial cavity (type 3 perforation ${ }^{2}$ ) at the level of the mid-Cx (Fig. 1c). A 2.0 mm over-thewire balloon was positioned in the proximal Cx and was inflated to 8 atmospheres, occluding the vessel. Because balloon occlusion alone did not seal the perforation, 3 ml of EmboGold $300-500 \mu \mathrm{m}$ microspheres (Biosphere Medical, Roissy, Paris), suspended 1:1 in diluted contrast solution, were slowly injected distally through the central balloon lumen. Balloon inflation was maintained for 8 min to prevent reflux of microspheres into the LAD and aorta. As the artery was occluded distal to the perforation, there was no risk of microspheres entering distal collaterals. Repeat angiography revealed complete occlusion of the Cx at the embolisation site with no further leakage of contrast into the pericardial space (Fig. 1d).

Post-embolisation, a further 270 ml of blood was drained over 24 h. Subsequent echocardiography showed a small circumferential rim of fluid, with no sign of tamponade.



## Discussion

Management of coronary artery perforation includes reversal of anticoagulation, pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade and, when necessary, definitive treatment of the perforation. While emergency surgery may be required, percutaneous techniques are often successful. ${ }^{3,4}$ Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents ${ }^{6}$ and autologous vein grafts covered stents ${ }^{7}$ are useful in larger vessels in which the delivery system can be tracked to the perforation site. For distal vessel guidewire perforations and perforations of occluded or small calibre vessels, embolisation with microcoils, ${ }^{8}$ gelfoam, ${ }^{9}$ polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles ${ }^{10}$ have been reported to be effective. The published literature comprises case reports, with no method clearly demonstrated to be superior. In this case, it was felt that the vessel was too small for coil embolisation or covered-stent placement. Our previous experience with gelfoam was that injection through the central lumen of a standard angioplasty balloon catheter could sometimes be difficult. Bench testing with microspheres, however, had shown that that they were easily injected down the $0.014^{\prime \prime}$ catheter and appeared suitable for sealing this perforation.

Coronary perforation in our patient was related to the attempted crossing of a chronically occluded vessel in the setting of intense anti-platelet therapy. In retrospect, attempted percutaneous intervention to a noninfarct related chronic occlusion might better have been undertaken as a second-stage procedure. Percutaneous intervention was promptly aborted upon the detection of contrast extravasation outside the vessel. Continuation of the trial medication (eptifabatide or placebo) may have contributed to continued bleeding into the pericardium. Microspheres, a novel embolisation agent, were chosen because of potential limitations of other techniques in treating this particular perforation.

Microspheres, containing an acrylic co-polymer (trisacryl) cross-linked with gelatin, were developed as an alternative to PVA particles in interventional radiology. They are designed to be hydrophilic, deformable, uniformly spherical particles with a narrow range of particle diameters, contrasting with PVA particles which are irregularly shaped with sharp and jagged edges. A $300-500 \mu \mathrm{m}$ suspension contains approximately 10,000 microspheres per millilitre. Problems with PVA particles, such as particle aggregation, hub accumulation and catheter occlusion, are not observed with microspheres. Particulate penetration into a vascular lesion is improved because of avoidance of aggregate formation. ${ }^{11}$ Histological studies have demonstrated a mild-to-moderate inflammatory reaction around the microspheres with no evidence of degradation observed in specimens more than 6 months after embolisation. ${ }^{12}$ Previous studies have demonstrated a tight correlation between the diameter of the microspheres injected and the size of the occluded vessel. ${ }^{12}$ Therefore, it is likely that vessels of $300 \mu \mathrm{m}$ or larger were occluded by the microspheres, with thrombus formation also contributing to the total occlusion of the LCx. $300-500-\mu \mathrm{m}$ microspheres were chosen in our case, based upon the diameter of the perforated artery and the minimum inner diameter of the $0.014^{\prime \prime}$ catheter. The elastic properties of the microspheres allow for temporary compression of up to $33 \%$, facilitating the passage of microspheres through injection catheters.

To our knowledge, this is the first case report of coronary artery perforation treated successfully by transcatheter injection of tris-acryl gelatin microspheres. While there is a range of options for managing coronary artery perforation, the use of microsphere embolisation appeared effective in this case and should be considered part of the armoury for managing this serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.

Late stent thrombosis (> 1 year after implantation) is a recognised complication involving drug-eluting stents. Stent fracture is increasingly being reported as a complication of drug-eluting stent, and in particular sirolimus-eluting stent use. We report the case of very late sirolimus-eluting stent fracture resulting in an acute coronary syndrome. This case report highlights the need for greater awareness and post-marketing surveillance to detect a potential mechanism for late stent thrombosis in the drug-eluting stent era.

## Introduction

The use of drug-eluting stents has been demonstrated to lower in-stent restenosis (ISR) rates, however the incidence of late complications such as stent thrombosis has raised concern over their use. In addition, there has been increasing awareness of stent fracture as a potential complication following drug-eluting stent implantation. We report a case of sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) fracture precipitating acute coronary syndrome more than 3 years after stent deployment.

## Case History

A 65-year-old man underwent coronary angiography for investigation of exertional angina. This confirmed critical lesions in the first obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery (Fig. 1) with minor disease elsewhere and normal left ventriculography. Percutaneous coronary intervention to the culprit lesion was undertaken. The lesion was pre-dilated with $2.0 \mathrm{~mm} \times 10 \mathrm{~mm}$ conventional angioplasty balloon to 12 atm ., followed by deployment of a $2.75 \mathrm{~mm} \times 30 \mathrm{~mm}$ SES to 12 atm ., with an excellent final result (Fig. 2).

[^0]The patient had an uneventful recovery and remained symptom free for almost 3.5 years, before re-presenting with a troponin positive acute coronary syndrome and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia in the lateral leads. Coronary angiography was repeated, revealing complete fracture of the previous SES near the midpoint. There was clear displacement of the stent segments from each other, resulting in a kink within the exposed artery (Fig. 3). The other coronary arteries remained unchanged. The stent fracture was treated with direct deployment of a $3.0 \mathrm{~mm} \times 13 \mathrm{~mm}$ SES to 12 atm ., followed by post-dilatation with a $3.5 \mathrm{~mm} \times 8 \mathrm{~mm}$ Powersail balloon to 12 atm ., with an excellent final result (Fig. 4). The patient remained well at 12-month follow-up, with a negative exercise treadmill test featuring normal exercise capacity.

## Discussion

Despite substantial clinical experience with drug-eluting stents in randomised trials and post-marketing registry surveillance, coronary stent fracture has not been highlighted as a significant clinical issue in the published literature. Nonetheless, awareness of this possible complication has recently begun to emerge with the publication of isolated case reports and small series. One such series suggested the prevalence of stent fracture may be as high as $1.9 \%,{ }^{1}$ with stent fracture occurring in 10 of 530 patients undergoing clinically indicated repeat coronary angiography. All of these cases of stent fracture involved sirolimus-eluting
