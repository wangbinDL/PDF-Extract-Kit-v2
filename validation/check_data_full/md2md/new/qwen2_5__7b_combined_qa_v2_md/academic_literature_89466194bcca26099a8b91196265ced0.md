#### Abstract

Conodonts have played an important role in the construction of a Triassic timescale. Each of the stage boundaries is reviewed in the context of their evolving conodont faunas. The base Triassic (Induan) is defined by the appearance of Hindeodus parvus, which developed from H. praeparvus; a parallel zonation is provided by Neogondolella species. For the InduanOlenekian boundary, the appearance of Neospathodus waageni sensu lato within a plexus of similar species is favoured as the defining datum; Borinella and Eurygnathodus also appear about this time. The base of the Middle Triassic Anisian stage lies close to the appearance of Chiosella, with Triassospathodus and Spathicuspus characterizing the late Olenekian, and Gladigondolella tethydis and Nicoraella confined to the Anisian. Proxies for the Anisian-Ladinian boundary, which is defined by an ammonoid, are the first Budurovignathus species. The basal Carnian, also defined by an ammonoid, lies close to the first metapolygnathids, including M. polygnathiformis and M. tadpole. The Carnian-Norian boundary interval is characterized by many new taxa in Canada, but only a few species are common to Tethys, notably Metapolygnathus ex gr. M. echinatus. The Norian-Rhaetian boundary is likely to be based on evolution in Misikella in Tethys, with concurrent changes recognized in North American Epigondolella.


Conodonts arrived late on the stage of early Mesozoic timescale definition, yet they have become increasingly important in helping to define the Global Stratotype Section and Points (GGSP) of Triassic stages. In just 40 years of modern study, these microfossils have been used to define one GSSP (base Induan), feature in two others that are defined (Ladinian, Carnian), and are favoured as indices for all of the remaining boundaries under consideration. This is not an unusual situation in the Palaeozoic, but in the Triassic conodonts have competed with traditional ammonoid indices, unlike later Mesozoic periods wherein conodonts no longer existed. Although there is no denying the pivotal role of ammonoids in Triassic timescale studies, conodonts benefit from their greater abundance, widespread distribution, and great resilience. Hence, they can often provide a continuous bed-by-bed sampling record, and occur in a variety of strata representing marine habitats ranging from深 ocean to shallow-shelf, as well as in rocks metamorphosed to at least greenschist grade. Of course, like many other common fossils, they offer no solution to the dating and correlation of nonmarine strata.
This paper reviews the current status of conodont succession around each Triassic stage boundary, and shows how they may be used to define Triassic GSSPs (Fig. 1). In the following account, the authorship of species is noted only at their first mention. Illustrated specimens are deposited in the National Type Collection of Invertebrate and Plant Fossils at the Geological Survey of Canada, 601 Booth Street, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0E8 Canada.

## Base Triassic, Changshingian-Induan boundary (Figs $2 \& 3$ )

The GSSP of the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) was ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences in 2001 (Yin et al. 2001). It is defined at the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of the conodont Hindeodus parvus (Kozur \& Pjataková) within the H. praeparvus Kozur-H. parvusIsarcicella isarcica (Huckriede) lineage (Ding et al. 1996; Kozur 1996) at the base of Bed 27c of Meishan section D, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, South China. Focus on this boundary led to a substantial revision of Hindeodus and the derivative Isarcicella (Orchard 2007 b, p. 97-98). Forty years ago, only single species of Hindeodus ('Anchignathodus' typicalis Sweet) and Isarcicella ('Spathognathodus' isarcicus) were identified in PTB strata. The impetus generated by research on the boundary has now resulted in the differentiation of at least 25 species of these two genera, including a subdivision of $H$. latidentatus Kozur, Mostler \& Rahimi-Yazd, the originally proposed precursor of H. parvus, into two subspecies. One of these, $H$. praeparvus, is now being regarded as the immediate forerunner of the PTB index, whereas $H$. latidentatus is part of an entirely different Hindeodus lineage according to Nicoll et al. (2002). Similarly, $H$. parvus and other derivatives have been subdivided, and the phylogeny of the group is becoming increasingly refined (Nicoll et al. 2002; Perri \& Farabegoli 2003) with many stratigraphically useful species now identified (Fig. 2). Hindeodus

parvus has a worldwide distribution not only throughout Tethys but also in western Pangaea (Paull \& Paull 1994) and the Boreal region (Henderson \& Baud 1996), and it occurs both in shallow water and pelagic deposits (Kozur 1996). In some biofacies, Hindeodus occurs alone (e.g. Werfen facies), but elsewhere Neogondolella (Clarkina of authors) is also common due to palaeoecological factors, as discussed by Nicoll et al. (2002). In these cases, the succession within Neogondolella provides a parallel zonation, as it does throughout the Late Permian.

One particularly useful PTB species of Neogondolella is N. taylorae Orchard, which characterizes the lowest Triassic at Selong (Orchard et al. 1994) and Spiti (Orchard \& Krystyn 1998). The forerunner of the latter species is N.zhejiangensis (Mei) ( $=$ Clarkina praetaylorae Kozur: Kozur 2004; Chen et al. 2008). Reports of N. taylorae in latest Permian strata in Iran (Kozur 2005) and China ( Ji et al. 2006) suggest that both that species, and several others first described from the basal Triassic, originated during the Permian. According to Korte et al. (2004), there are additional species that are missing from the latest Permian part of the GSSP succession at Meishan. Apparently, several lineages of neogondolellaceans can be differentiated among PTB populations, many of which were originally submerged in Neogondolella carinata (Clark), a species that commonly occurs in Griesbachian strata. Clarkina may be a suitable name for one of these lineages. Another important line that provides zonal indices links N. nassichuki Orchard with the progressively younger N. krystyni Orchard, N. discreta Orchard \& Krystyn, and Sweetospathodus kummeli(Sweet) (Orchard 2007b).

## Induan-Olenekian boundary (Figs $4 \& 5$ )

The conodont succession around the InduanOlenekian Boundary (IOB) is best known from two localities: the West Pingdingshan Section in Chaohu, Anhui Province, eastern China (Zhao et al. 2007, 2008a, b), and the Mud section in the Pin valley of Spiti, India (Krystyn et al. 2007a, b; Orchard \& Krystyn 2007; Orchard 2007e). The latter locality is favoured as GSSP because of its better ammonoid record. The first appearance of the conodont Neospathodus waageni Sweet sensu lato has been chosen as the best datum for definition, as suggested by Tong et al. (2004a). In Chaohu, this datum lies 26 cm below the FAD of poorly preserved ammonoids assigned to Flemingites and Euflemingites (Tong et al. 2004b; Zakharov 2004). In Spiti, the boundary strata include a Gyronites fauna that is replaced by a succession of flemingitid ammonoid faunas (Krystyn et al. 2007a, b) (Fig. 4).

In spite of its widespread distribution, both the sub-speciation and origin of Neospathodus waageni is the subject of ongoing research. In general, the late Induan (Dienerian) conodont record is low in diversity and most commonly consists of specimens assigned to Neospathodus dieneri Sweet. Zhao et al. (2007) distinguished three morphotypes of this species based on the posterior denticle formation, and suggested that morphotype 3 of N. dieneri (with reduced posterior denticles) gave rise to N. waageni. Orchard (2007b) suggested an alternative origin in N. pakistanensis Sweet, which has posterior denticulation similar to that of N. waageni. All these taxa are morphologically similar and differ largely in the characteristics of the posterior denticles and in the relative length: height ratio of the elements. Again, this reflects the initial stages in the major diversification of Neospathodus around the IOB, which almost certainly included changes in their multielement configuration, too. Little is known about the apparatuses of these taxa at the IOB, although later

Smithian waageni morphotypes are believed to be examples of Novispathodus.

Zhao et al. (2004) identified three variants of N. waageni, two of which (N. waageni eowaageni Zhao \& Orchard and N. waageni waageni) are now regarded as subspecies, and one of which (N. posterolongatus Zhao \& Orchard) has subsequently been given species status. These three taxa appeared at slightly different levels in the Chaohu section: $N$. waageni eowaageni first, followed by N. posterolongatus and then N. waageni waageni. This is not clearly the case in Spiti, where Orchard \& Krystyn (2007) emphasized the intraspecific variation of N. waageni by differentiating five early Olenekian morphotypes. Zhao et al. (2008a) added a sixth morphotype. The stratigraphic value of these variants has yet to be clearly demonstrated, so the FAD of N. waageni sensu lato is currently taken as the base of the Olenekian. However, the variants do serve to emphasize the tremendous evolutionary radiation that was taking place at the beginning of the Olenekian (early Smithian) (Orchard 2007b).

In the Lower Triassic, China was located in the eastern part of low latitude Tethys, whereas Spiti represents higher palaeolatitude Gondwanaland margin. The differing faunal provincialities in these two regions led to some differences in the conodont faunas around the IOB, particularly the abundance of Neospathodus pakistanensis and Borinella nepalensis (Kozur \& Mostler) in Spiti, and the absence of the latter taxon in China. Other conodont guide fossils for the IOB include Neospathodus chii Zhao \& Orchard, N. concavus Zhao \& Orchard, and N. cyclodontus Zhao \& Orchard, which are derivatives of N. dieneri; N. spitiensis Goel, which is the successor of N. posterolongatus; and the peculiar platform elements Eurygnathodus costatus Staesche and E. hamadai Koike. The first representatives of Discretella? and Spathicuspus also appear in the early Olenekian (Fig. 4).

Olenekian-Anisian boundary (Figs $6 \& 7$ )
The most complete ammonoid succession known from the Olenekian-Anisian boundary (OAB) interval in Tethys is within condensed Hallstatt limestone facies at Desli Caira in Dobrogea, Romania, where the latest Olenekian Deslicairitesbearing ammonoid beds are succeeded by beds with early Anisian Paracrochordiceras and Japonites, and then by an interval characterized as the Aegeiceras ugra beds (Gradientaru et al. 2007). Other significant biotic changes involving conodonts, orthocerids, nautilids, and foraminiferids are recognized at this palaeontologically-defined boundary (Gradientaru et al. 2007), which is located in between two short normal magnetic polarity intervals, and close to the end of a gradual increase in $\delta^{13} \mathrm{C}$ isotope values.

In Nevada, USA, ammonoids of the early Anisian Japonites welteri Zone overlie those of the Spathian Neopopanoceras haugi Zone (Bucher
1989; Guex et al. 2005a, b), whereas in Union Wash, California (Stone et al. 1991), an additional latest Spathian interval, the Courtilloticeras stevensi beds are differentiated (Galfetti et al. 2007). The ammonoid zonation established in western and northern Canada (Tozer 1994) places the Silberlingites mulleri Zone, which is younger than the basal Anisian, above the late Spathian Keyserlingites

subrobustus Zone. A locality in Guandao in Guizhou Province, south China lacks a significant ammonoid fauna but does contain an important conodont succession as well as radiometrically-dated tuff beds (Lehrmann et al. 2006).

Published conodont data from each of these localities (Orchard 1994, 2008; Graipheru et al. 2007) show the traditional ammonoid-based OAB closely coincides with the appearance of the conodont Chiosella timorensis (Nogami), whereas upper Olenekian (Spathian) strata are dominated by Triassospathodus ex gr. homeri (Bender). The conodont C. gondolelloides (Bender), the precursor of C. timorensis, straddles the boundary, appearing first in the Deslicairites beds in Romania, and in the stevensi beds in California. The relatively expanded section at Guandao, China, sampled in detail for conodonts, provides a useful corroboration of the conodont succession (Orchard et al. 2007b).

In both the Guandao and Desli Caira sections (Orchard et al. 2007a), parallels may be seen in the range of Triassospathodus homeri and

N. regalis Mosher appears slightly later in both China and Romania, although in North America similar forms appear first within the Spathian (Orchard

2007b, 2008). This boundary interval is marked by a significant faunal change as the proportion of T. homeri and S. spathi drops dramatically (Orchard et al. 2007a, Figs 4-5). Nicoraella germanica (Kozur) is a distinctive and widespread early Anisian species, and Neospathodus triangularis Bender is a typical late Spathian one.

Prior to 1995, the differentiation of Chiosella gondolelloides and C. timorensis was not widely accepted (see Orchard 1995; Graçă Dolinaru et al. 2006), so older literature is ambiguous in the sense that the two species of Chiosella were often combined. Similarly, at least some early reports of C. timorensis from the Spathian of the USA (Collinson \& Hassenmueller 1978) were based on Triassospathodus homeri (Orchard 1994), which completely dominates collections from the late Spathian Haugi Zone. The latter species is similar in some respects to C. timorensis but is much shorter and lacks platform flanges. It was thought to be ancestral to Chiosella (Bender 1970), but this is not supported by their significantly different multielement apparatuses (Orchard 2005). Chiosella n. sp. A, characterized by a strong terminal cusp, is a form that appears slightly later in Tethys than the other Chiosella species, more or less coincident in both Guandao sections with a 'second wave' of Chiosella that is separated from the first by a

## Anisian-Ladinian boundary (Figs 8 \& 9)

The GSSP of the Anisian-Ladinian boundary ( ALB ) is defined at the appearance of the ammonoid Eoprotrachyceras curionii in the Caffaro River bed near Bagolino in the Italian Dolomites (Brack et al. 2005). The appearance of the conodont Budurovignathus praehungaricus (Kovacs) near the top of the underlying Nevadites secedensis Zone provides a proxy for the ALB. This conodont species probably developed from Neogondolella aequidentata Kozur, Krainer \& Lutz and, in turn, is the precursor of the younger Budurovignathus species that are important in Ladinian biochronology.

Additional and often more abundant conodont taxa of the ALB beds belong to the groups of Neogondolella constricta (Mosher \& Clark), Paragondolella excelsa Mosher, and N. alpina (Kozur \& Mostler). However, most of these taxa appear well below the boundary, and several range across it. Other useful ALB taxa, including Neogondolella postcornuta (Kovacs), 'Ng.' trammeri (Kozur), and Gladigondolella malayensis Nogami, appear confined to Tethyan successions.

In North America, the most complete ALB successions occur in the Prida Formation (Star Peak Group) in the Humboldt Range of northwestern Nevada, specifically at the 'Fossil Hill' and 'Saurian Hill' sites documented by Silberling \& Nichols (1982). This was the type area where Silberling \& Tozer (1968) defined (in ascending order) the upper Anisian Gymnotoceras rotelliformis, Parafrechites meeki, and Frechites occidentalis zones, and the lower Ladinian Eoprotrachyceras subasperum Zone, and where more recent work by Bucher \& Orchard (1995) intercalibrated the ammonoid and conodont faunas. The Occidentalis Zone at the top of the Anisian originally comprised, in ascending order, the Nevadites hyatti beds, Nevadites humboldtensis beds, Paranevadites furlongi beds, and Paranevadites gabbi beds, although more recently the first of these have been dropped (Ovtcharova et al. 2006). The first occurrence of protrachyceratids has been regarded as defining the base of the Ladinian stage, which includes a succession of differing Eoprotrachyceras beds, of which the second comprise the Eoprotrachyceras lahontanum beds (Bucher \& Orchard 1995).

Two levels of significant conodont faunal change are identified within the ALB interval in Nevada, although details of the succession are unpublished. One level corresponds to the base of the Occidentalis Zone ( $N$. hyatti beds), the other to the Eoprotrachyceras lahontanum beds. The first is marked by the appearance of several new taxa, and the reappearance of others. Both Neogondolella cornuta Budurov \& Stefanov, a member of the $N$. constricta group, and Paragondolella liebermani (Kovacs \& Krystyn) become more common, and derivatives of the N. szaboi (Kovacs)-N. alpina stock, including N. ex gr. N. pridaensis (Nicora, Kovacs \& Mietto) and N. n. sp. B, are often dominant; N. aequidentata also appears. The second distinctive conodont datum occurs in the Eoprotrachyceras lahontanum beds and is marked by the appearance of common Budurovignathus praehungaricus, a proxy for the ALB, rare B. gabriellae Kozur, Krainer \& Mostler, and new Paragondolella species.

## Ladinian-Carnian boundary (Figs 10 \& 11)

The Ladinian-Carnian boundary (LCB) is defined at the appearance of the ammonoid Daxatina canadensis at the Prati di Stuores/Stuores Wiesen section in the Italian Dolomites (Manco et al. 2004; Mietto et al. 2007). Unfortunately, conodonts are very scarce, due to the high sedimentation rate in this part of the section, but they become more frequent in higher beds associated with the ammonoid Trachyceras aon, the level at which the base of the Carnian was traditionally drawn. The conodont Metapolygnathus ex gr. M. polygnathiformis (Budurov \& Stefanov), characteristic of the Carnian, first occurs close to the Daxatina datum, although it is very rare at the GSSP site.

Other areas that have provided key data on the LCB are sections in Spiti, India; New Pass in Nevada, USA; and the Liard Basin in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The classical sections of the Spiti Valley in the Western Himalayas, India, have shown that the appearance of

Metapolygnathus ex gr. M. polygnathiformis predates the incoming of Daxatina by several metres, in spite of the slow accumulation rates of the Spiti sections (Balini et al. 2004; Krystyn et al. 2004). South Canyon in New Pass, Nevada, USA, appears to be the best known section for the boundary interval so far described in North America (Silberling \& Tozer 1968). There, indices for both the Frankites sutherlandi (traditionally Ladinian) and Trachyceras desatoyense zones (lowest Carnian) co-occur with both Daxatina and M. ex gr. M. polygnathiformis (Balini et al. 2007; Orchard \& Balini 2007). The new definition of the LCB places the upper part of the Sutherlandi Zone in the Carnian.

several new species, were described recently by Orchard (2007c). The interval can be very broadly divided into a lower part characterized by Budurovignathus mungoensis (Diebel) and an upper part with Mosherella newpassensis (Mosher). This division is also quite evident at New Pass in Nevada (Orchard \& Balini 2007), although at that locality there is an overlap between the two species that is not observed in British Columbia, probably as a result of insufficient sampling between ammonoid beds. The succession of Budurovignathus and Mosherella species lacks clear speciation events to serve as biochronological markers, whereas the development of Metapolygnathus from Paragondolella and the diversification within the former facilitates a new conodont zonation for the LCB in North America. Paragondolella inclinata (Kovacs) represents the root stock from which one evolutionary trend involved the progressive reduction of the anterior platform. This gave rise, in ascending order, to the inclinata, intermedius, and tadpole zones, with the first subdivided into sulcata and acuminatus subzones (Orchard 2007c). These zones subdivide the North American Sutherlandi ammonoid Zone and adjacent zones (Tozer 1994), with the acuminatus-intermedius zonal boundary closely coincident with the appearance of Daxatina; Metapolygnathus polygnathiformis sensu stricto appears a little before this boundary. The tadpole Zone, as interpreted by Orchard (2007c), extends from high in the Sutherlandi Zone through the lower Carnian Austrotrachyceras obesum and Sirenites nanseni zones.

In contrast to North America, several Budurovignathus species are common in the Tethyan sections. This includes B. diebeli (Kozur \& Mostler), earlier proposed as a potential index for the LCB. These taxa may be endemic because only B. mungoensis is known from North America. Conversely, Mosherella species, common in North America, appear to be absent in Tethys.

## Carnian-Norian boundary (Figs 12 \& 13)

In North America, ammonoid successions in Nevada and British Columbia led to a proposal that the base of the CNB be assigned to the base of the Stikinoceras kerri ammonoid Zone, which overlies the Klamathites macrolobatus Zone (Silberling \& Tozer 1968; Tozer 1994). In Tethys, this level is approximately coeval with a boundary drawn between the Anatropites and Guembelites jandianus ammonoid zones (Krystyn 1980).

Preliminary biostratigraphic work in western Canada (Orchard 1983; Orchard \& Tozer 1997)



Fig. 11. (Continued)
showed that the base of the Stikinoceras kerri Zone falls within the range of Metapolygnathus primitius (Mosher) and often corresponds to the appearance of Norigondolella navicula (Huckriede). However, the incoming of the latter species, although a useful guide, is an unsatisfactory datum for definition because of apparent facies control on its appearance. This being the case, Orchard et al. (2000) sought better correspondence of faunal changes in ammonoids, conodonts, and radiolarians and suggested that the datum at the base of the Klamathites macrolobatus Zone might serve as a CNB because both M. primitius and M. ex gr. M. communisti Hayashi appeared at about that level in British Columbia. However, much more detailed work at Black Bear Ridge Ridge on Williston Lake in northeastern British Columbia has now shown that there is in fact good correspondence between ammonoid, bivalve, and conodont faunal change at, or close to, the traditional level (Orchard et al. 2001, 2007a; McRoberts 2007). Several new upper Carnian conodont zones are now identified in British Columbia based on forms currently combined as Metapolygnathus (Fig. 12; Orchard et al. 2001; Orchard 2007a, d). The first appearance of Metapolygnathus ex gr. M. echinatus (Hayashi) lies close to the base of the Kerri Zone and coincides with a major faunal turnover whereby subsequent faunas are

dominated by the primitius group. This datum also corresponds to the appearance of new halobiid species (McRoberts 2007) and is consequently now favoured as the CNB datum in North America.
A second GSSP candidate for the CNB is in Tethys, at Pizzo Mondello in Sicily (Nicora et al. 2007). Preliminary conodont data show both similarities and significant differences in the faunal succession compared with North America. This is compounded by unresolved nomenclatural issues. Compared with Canada, Carniepigondolella ex gr. C. samueli (Orchard) ranges much higher, and Epigondolella ex gr. E. quadrata Orchard appears much earlier. Also, whereas M. primitius, M. n. sp. I, M. n. sp. P, M. n. sp. Q, and M. n. sp. Y (see Orchard 2007a for illustrations) are common at Black Bear Ridge, they are rare or absent at Pizzo Mondello, where M. communisti is far more common. In Tethys, the first occurrence of M. communisti lies close to the base of the Jandianus Zone (Krystyn 1980). The appearance of this species and its associates M. parvus (Kozur) and

M. echinatus seem to be a good option for intercontinental correlation.

Norian-Rhaetian boundary (Fig 14 \& 15) The Rhaetian stage was introduced for the uppermost Triassic Kössen Beds in the Northern Calcareous Alps with the brachiopod Rhaetavicula contorta as the guide form. According to Golebiowski (1990), R. contorta begins within Unit 2 of the Hochalm Member of the Kössen Formation, also the level of the first appearance of Misikella posthernsteini Kozur \& Mock (Kozur \& Bachmann 2005). However, in places its precursor M. hernsteini (Mostler) occurs at the base of the Kössen Beds (Golebiowski 1986, 1990; Krystyn 1990). Recent deliberation has considered the relative merits of the FO of the two Misikella species as defining taxa for the Norian-Rhaetian boundary (NRB) at the Steinbergkogel section in Austria (Krystyn et al. 2007b).

In North American ammonoid biochronology, the base of the Paracochloceras amoenum Zone, which can be correlated with the base of the Cochloceras suessi Zone in the Tethys (Kozur 1996, 2003), is favoured as a Rhaetian base (Orchard \& Tozer 1997). In western North America, Misikella is rare and does not provide a practical guide fossil for boundary definition. Rather, species of Epigondolella are common and apparently range higher into the Rhaetian than they do in Tethys: the base of the Amoenum Zone corresponds closely to the FAD of E. mosheri (Kozur \& Mostler) Morphotype A Orchard in both western Canada and Nevada, USA (Orchard \& Tozer 1997, p. 685; Orchard et al. 2007c). In British Columbia, rare Misikella posthernsteini are only known from the upper Rhaetian Choristoceras crickmayi Zone (Orchard \& Tozer 1997).

The most distinctive faunal change for characterizing the base of the Rhaetian in the oceanic realm is the base of the radiolarian Proparvicingula moniliformis Zone (Carter 1993; Carter \& Orchard 2004). In the Queen Charlotte Islands, Canada, this radiolarian zone is characterized by the appearance of Epigondolella mosheri Morphotype A, whereas in Baja California Misikella posthernsteini occurs together with radiolarians of the lower P. moniliformis Zone (Whalen et al. 2003; Orchard et al. 2007d). Hence, broad equivalence of the appearance of E. mosheri and M. posthernsteini is implied (see also Kozur 2003).
