# AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE TEACHING OF CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES 

Mary G. Kelty<br>Chicago, Illinois<br>Nelle E. Moore<br>Supervisor of Elementary Education, Wilmette, Illinois

In the period during and immediately following the great war interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in our schools. Many junior and senior high schools experimented with methods and materials in current events and adopted a program, either providing special classes in the subject or making specific correlation with history, civics, or oral English as time permitted. Suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the intermediate grades have occasionally been put forward, but so far as these suggestions have not been given serious consideration except by a very few. The general feeling seems to have been that children in the middle grades are too immature, their background of information too restricted, and their reading ability too limited to warrant the high expectation that they might be able to understand present-day problems.

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades. During several semesters many of them gave up the attempt, feeling that the available materials to be unsuited for the use of boys and girls in that age group. Others have continued the study during one reading period, even though they did not feel fully satisfied with the results. Of them, however, so far as the writers are aware, have made no effort to measure results or presented evidence as to the child'en's understanding or interest.

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in education. The results of the great improvement in silent reading habits are only beginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire field of



school system, especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children in the upper elementary grades in some communities read some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of youngsters for stimulating and challenging materials is being keenly felt. At the same time there has been a very genuine and depressing lack of organization of materials, with the objective of choosing and presenting content and activities in line with social values and life-situations. Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience as possible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom. Valuable allies for such an attempt are now furnished by the news reels in the motion-picture houses and by the rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers, both of which are usually available to elementary-school children throughout the country.

Like all other students of the social sciences, the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investigate their effects on the ability of middle-grade children to read current events. Most opportunely, an invitation came to them to undertake for a period of two years, ending in June, 1931, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.
The first problem was the setting-up of an educational program.
It was obvious that materials chosen for young children should be subjected to a double test: (1) accuracy and (2) suitability to children's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.

# GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 

I. [Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourthgrade work.] Most fourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.



2. A complete résumé of the news of the world is unsuited to and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades. Topics should be fully selected, and only a few should be presented at one time.
3. A variety of interests should be built up- political, geographic, economic, mechanical, artistic, scientific, etc. Foreign news should be given prominent place as well as domestic news.
4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an important phase of world-news. It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding. A few other short articles (perhaps two to four) may deal with other selected topics.
5. When feasible, the leading articles may well alternate foreign and domestic news. They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.
6. In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly constituted a leading article.
7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appearance in a current-events paper. The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.
8. Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to current events, the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour a week.
9. Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers produced for adults, the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.
1o. Children's information can be tested. Their interest in the materials, however, can best be judged by their classroom teachers.

THE CONDUCTING OF THE EXPERIMENT
From the outset the experiment faced a serious difficulty owing to the physical makeup of the paper. The fact that the capacity of the mimeograph machine was $50 \times 8 \frac{1}{2}$ inches in size necessitated the use of very small type, which seriously impaired the value of the few pictures that were included. The results secured were attained in spite of these handicaps. Teachers were helped in making the reading more interesting, however, by a sheet on " Training in Events," which was sent out at the beginning of the experiment. Many teachers clipped and mimeographed. Each weekly issue contained a leading article, from which was developed a series of shorter articles, and an entire page devoted to tests in various forms. The tests were informal objective types, with keys, based upon comprehension of the leading article. The "activities" suggested things to read, to write, to figure, and to collect, in order to interest and to develop understanding.



All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grades, and to observing the reactions of small groups of children to various types of materials that were presented weekly. At the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the plan might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of the publishers the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to minister the weekly tests, record their results on a tabular sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. As a result 22 teachers reported for one, two, or three terms but did not complete the entire year. These schools represented large cities, rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations, and the publishers also generously co-operated in printing and furnishing record sheets.

In addition to a tabulation of the test results, the teachers were asked to furnish the following information.



# To BE FILLED OUT AT THE END OF NINE WEEKS 

## enslare

I. To the Teacher: Ask the children to write the answers to the questions and, in the blanks below, fill in the names of the stories giving the highest votes with the reason most generally given.
A. Which of the front-page stories that you have read in the Numbers 1 to 9 , inclusive, do you like best? (Look back in your book if you do not remember the names of the front-page stories.)
Name of story
Why did you like it best?
B. Which second best?
Name of story
Why did you like it?
C. Which third best?
Name of story
Why did you like it?
II. Ask the children to write "yes" or "no" in answer to the following question. Names need not be signed.
Does your family take a daily newspaper?
A weekly newspaper?
It was soon evident that classes in current events were unsuitable for most fourth grades.

a) Very helpful
b) Helpful
c) Not of much help
5. If you feel that this page is not of much help, will you please tell what changes would make it more valuable to you?

## THE FINDINGS

In order that the reader may understand the type of news events material used in the study, the titles of the first fifteen stories are given in Table I. The classifications into political, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the stories.

A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. Of the stories of domestic news ranked first, second, or third in interest to these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received no preference. Seven of the favorite stories are classified as political, five are classified as geographical, and three as economic. The choices of these children seem to indicate that fifth- and sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and domestic affairs, with a decided preference for stories presenting character-interest.








and that they have greater interest in the important phases of the news than has been commonly believed by teachers and administrators.

| Classification of Stories | NUMBER OF STORIES |  |  |

| Geographical | o | $\bigcirc$ | - |
| Economic and social...... | ○ | ○ | ○ |
| Total. | 2 | 2 | $\overline{2}$ |
| Domestic: <br> Political and historical.... | I | I | I |
| Geographical............ | $\overline{\mathrm{I}}$ | $\overline{\mathrm{I}}$ | II |
| Economic and social ... | $I^{-}$ | II | 2 |
| Total. | 3 | 2 | 4 |

Table III shows the types of illustrations which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories out of the thirty-five had no front-page illustrations, but as many as twenty-three of these could have been made more attractive to the average reader by the addition of one or more attractive and informative illustrations. This may be attached to the fact that fourteen of the thirty-five had no front-page illustrations as first, second, or third choices had front-page illustrations.

While this study secured no data as to the appearance of the paper from the point of view of size of the pages, the experimenters feel that the need for a larger paper is imperative. A larger paper with larger type, of course, cost much more than the middle-grade paper now available, and no commercial firm can be expected to continue the publication of a paper on the market unless the schools can subsidize its publication. An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of reading through objective tests-true-false, multiple-choice, and completion of outlines. A comparison of the results of these tests with the evaluations made by the pupils as a measure of the ease of reading as shown by these

Table IV
Comparative Ease of Reading Stories as Revealed by Comprehension Tests

| Number of Issue | Rank <br> as of <br> Reading <br> Choices | Rank <br> of Pupils' <br> Ease of <br> Reading <br> to, Kind of Test | Classification of Stories |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  |  | True-false | Domestic: geographical and economic |
| 6 | 2 | Multiple-choice | Foreign: political and historical |
| 8 | 3 | Multiple-choice | Foreign: political and historical |
|  |  |  |  |
| 14 | 1 | True-false | Domestic: economic and social |
| 16 | 2 | Multiple-choice | Foreign: geographical and economic |
| 15 | 3 | True-false | Foreign: political and historical |
|  |  |  |  |
| 27 | 1 | Multiple-choice | Foreign: political and historical |
| 23 | 2 | True-false | Domestic: geographical |
| 26 | 3 | Completion | Domestic: political and historical |
|  |  |  |  |
| 28 | 1 |  |  |
| 30 | 1.5 | True-false | Domestic: economic and social |
| 34 | $3 \cdot 5$ | True-false | Domestic: economic and social |
| 29 | 4 | Multiple-choice | Domestic: geographical |
|  |  |  |  |



cording to choices shows little or no relation between choice and ease of reading. However, the scores of the pupils on all the other tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the stories had been readily apprehended by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores consistently made on the true-false and the multiple-choice Tests were on the stories least difficult to read, the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were influenced by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading stories. Table IV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.

The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families read daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take daily papers and that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent take weekly papers. Teachers reported that about 50 per cent of the pupils gave evidence of reading family newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting disability information to the class.

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to language difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the language suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of material in the News Outline was sufficient to serve the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.

# Conclusions 

The data seem to justify the following conclusions. (1) Interesting world-news of a variety of types, including historical, geographical, economic, and social, can be presented to fifth- and sixth-grade pupils. (2) Fifth- and sixth-graders can read world-news intelligently if it is presented to the proper reading level, with necessary definitions and in language suitable for young people. It seems probable that classroom use of a current-events paper, supplemented by necesssary explanations and in language suitable for youthful comprehension, introduces pupils to important phases of world-news and acts as a guide to intelligent selection of material for individual reading. (4) Attractive illustrations influence pupils to read stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including supervisory notes for a thirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
