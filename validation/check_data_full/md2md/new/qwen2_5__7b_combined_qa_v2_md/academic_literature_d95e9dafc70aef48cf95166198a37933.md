#### Abstract

McDonald JS, Cavanaugh Jr PF, Pavelic LJ, Limardi RJ, Gluckman JL, Pavelic ZP. Prostaglandin H synthase isoenzyme distribution in the gingival tissue of patients with periodontitis: pronounced expression adjacent to Gram-positive bacteria. Inflammopharmacology. 1997;5:109-118. Prostaglandin ( $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ ) is an inflammatory mediator that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) a rate-limiting enzyme in $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ biosynthesis exists as two separate isoforms (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2). We have previously demonstrated that both isoforms are generally present in the gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. This study explores in greater detail the variable distribution of each isoenzyme in both inflamed and non-inflamed gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis, and the relationship to adjacent bacteria. Although the positive staining for PGHS-I was never as intense as for PGHS-2 in the same tissue specimen, either in inflamed or non-inflamed tissues, there was strong staining for both isoenzymes in the epithelium. The keratin layer did not stain. Non-keratinizing crevicular and junctional epithelium contained both isoenzymes through their full thickness in both inflamed and non-inflamed tissues. Pronounced staining of PGHS-2 was evident in the epithelia adjacent to Gram-positively stained organisms. In non-inflamed tissue, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were particularly evident in the spinous cell layer; however, fewer of the fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and resident mononuclear inflammatory cells stained positively for PGHS-1 as compared to PGHS-2, but this was less apparent in the inflamed tissues. The immunohistochemical staining patterns indicate that both crevicular and gingival epithelium are important sources of prostaglandin production in the gingival tissue of patients with periodontitis and that bacteria entrapped near to these sites may be important in promoting expression of inducible PGHS-2.

## INTRODUCTION

Prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{2}\right)$ is an inflammatory mediator that no doubt plays an important role in the alveolar bone and connective tissue destruction observed clinically in patients with active periodontal disease [1]. If untreated, this disease can eventually lead to loss of tooth function and possibly tooth loss [2]. It has been demonstrated conclusively in longitudinal clinical studies [3] that there is a significant



relationship between clinical attachment loss events occurring within six months following standard periodontal maintenance therapy such as scaling and root planing and the mean values of full mouth gingival crevicular fluid PGE2 (MCF-PGE2). The use of MCF-PGE2 measurements in periodontitis patients to predict future attachment loss events representative of disease progression was also found to have a high degree of sensitivity, specificity, and preditive value (ranging from 0.92 to 0.95 ).

The key rate-limiting enzymes in the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway leading to PGE2 production are the PGHS isoenzymes. Inhibition of these enzymes leads to a reduction in PGE2 levels. PGHS exists as two distinct and separately encoded isoforms, namely PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 [4]. PGHS-2 but not PGHS-1 is often elevated in inflamed tissues and is selectively increased in cells exposed to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or to interleukin- $1 \alpha$ or $\beta[5]$. LPS, IL- $1 \alpha$, and IL-1 $\beta$ have all been reported to be elevated in periodontally diseased gingival tissue and are believed to play a significant role in the inflammatory disease process [6-8].

PGHS is a valid molecular target for the chemotherapeutic treatment of periodontitis as demonstrated by the positive effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. naproxen, ketorolac tromethamine) in randomized controlled clinical trials [9-12]. In these clinical studies, NSAID treatment resulted in statistically significant reductions of alveolar bone loss versus placebo treatment without further loss of clinical attachment. The benefits of NSAID therapy for this chronic infectious and inflammatory disease has prompted further investigations regarding the regulation of PGE2 biosynthesis in gingival tissue at the level of PGHS isoenzyme expression. We recently reported the localization of both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 isoenzymes in mononuclear inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and in epithelial cells in the gingiva [13]. Progression of periodontitis is anatomically characterized by an apical migration of the epithelium along the tooth root. Since the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a PGE2-dependent event [14], the presence of both PGHS isoforms in the gingival epithelium further emphasizes the important role that prostaglandins play in periodontitis. The purpose of this study was to describe in greater detail the cellular distribution of each PGHS isoenzyme in both inflamed and non-inflamed gingival tissue in patients with periodontitis and association of the inducible PGHS-2 with bacteria.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS 

## Antibodies

Rabbit anti-human polyclonal anti-PGHS-2 antibody was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA. Rabbit anti-ovine polyclonal anti-PGHS-1 antibody was purchased from Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc., Oxford, MI, USA.



Tissue specimen processing and staining
Gingival tissue specimens were surgically removed from patients with periodontitis by a board-certified periodontist ( RJL ) as part of the normal course of periodontal therapy. Prior approval of the University of Cincinnati Institute Review Board was obtained. Each patient signed an informed consent form for the use of this tissue for research purposes. A total of 146 specimens were examined.

Tissues were fixed in an alcohol-based fixative, Omnifix-II (Ancon Genetics Inc., Melville, NY, USA), embedded in paraffin blocks and immunohistochemically stained for PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 as previously described [13]. All immunohistochemical slides were evaluated by a board-certified oral and maxillofacial pathologist (JSM).

# RESULTS 

The presence of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 isoenzyme proteins in serial tissue sections from the same tissue samples were shown in both inflamed and non-inflamed gingival tissue. While cytoplasmic staining of mononuclear inflammatory cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells was noted, the most intense cytoplasmic staining was observed in the gingival epithelial cells. PGHS expression as illustrated by staining intensity of the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells was consistently greater for PGHS-2 than PGHS-1 (Figures 1A,B and 2A,B). When keratinization was noted there was a well-delineated demarcation between the spinous cell layer and the keratin layer with the latter being consistently devoid of either protein (Figures 1A,B and 2A,B). The non-keratinizing epithelium demonstrated PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 expression through its full thickness (Figures 3A,B). In those areas where PGHS expression was not present through the full thickness of the gingival epithelium, its level of expression through the thickness of the spinous cell layer was consistent for each protein, first being evident in the basal and deep spinous cell layers (Figures 4A,B). PGHS-2 staining was observed in tissue adjacent to Gram-positive microorganisms, primarily cocci (Figures $4 D, E$ ). Despite the difference in PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 expression in the gingival epithelium, expression of each isoenzyme protein as judged from the intensity of the staining, or the relative number of cells stained, was less obvious in the connective tissue where staining intensity of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 in the cytoplasm of the mononuclear inflamamtory cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells was not always recognizably different.

## DISCUSSION

As reviewed by Birkedal-Hansen [15], connective tissue within the periodontium is destroyed in parallel by plasminogen-dependent and MMP-dependent pathways. Bacterial components such as LPS are potent stimulators of IL-1 production which in turn leads to elevations of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and enhanced levels of MMP gene expression. Serine proteinases such as urokinase type plasminogen activator are also increased by IL-1,

resulting in increased plasmin levels and enhanced activation of MMPs such as prostromelysin and procollagenase [16]. Both the activation of MMP and plasminogen activator have been demonstrated to be PGE2-dependent events [14,17]. Macrophages and endothelial cells are both known to be sources of constitutively expressed PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- $\alpha$, IL-1 $\beta$, and IL-1 $\gamma$ [5], with these cells having originally been proposed as the source of GCF PGE2 production.

A recent immunohistochemical study performed by our laboratory [13] demonstrated that the gingival epithelium is a rich and important source of prostaglandin production as revealed by the presence of both PGHS isoenzymes. As expected, both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were also immunohistochemically detected in gingival mononuclear inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. The present study



indicates that both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 isoenzyme proteins are present in inflamed and non-inflamed gingival tissue. PGHS expression as illustrated by staining intensity in the epithelium was consistently greater for PGHS-2 than for PGHS-1. Prostaglandin H synthase expression is first evident in the basal epithelial cells and is maintained in mature spinous cells with its presence being noted through the entire thickness of nonkeratinized epithelium and with a sharp line of demarcation being noted between spinous cells and the effete cells in the keratin layer in which their expression was not noted. From this, it is presumed that PGHS production continues throughout the functional life of the gingival epithelial cells.

In this study PGHS expression in gingival epithelium appeared independent of the degree of tissue inflammation since there was notably a lack of appreciable inflammatory cell infiltrates in those specimens where PGHS- 2 was being produced within the epithelium. As pointed out by Vane and Botting [18], while PGHS-1 is constitutively present, PGHS-2 is effectively absent from healthy tissues with its level rising dramatically during inflammation. As macrophages and endothelial cells may be induced to produce PGHS-2 by bacterial LPS, cytokines and growth factors, it can be presumed that the same agents are responsible for its production in epithelium. Recent studies in the field of septic shock have clearly demonstrated that cell wall constituents on Gram-positive organisms are also fully capable of producing an inflammatory response including the stimulation of cytokine and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ production [19]. Here we show that Gram-positive organisms are adjacent to regions of the epithelia which show particularly strong staining for PGHS-2. Because of the omnipresence of both Grampositive and Gram-negative organisms in the oral cavity and their ability to induce the production of PGHS-2, it is easy to understand how the production of this isoenzyme by bacterial products is important in gingival inflammation.

As reviewed by Offenbacher et al. [1], active adult periodontitis, juvenile, and refractory periodontitis all share the common hallmark of elevated $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ in GCF despite the disparate aetiological and pathogenetic mechanisms involved. This further suggests that these patients may have an altered regulation of PGHS-2 expression in response to either Gram-positive or possibly Gram-negative organisms in the oral cavity. Because of its abundance and the fact that it is bathed in GCF, the gingival epithelium would appear to be the most likely source of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ in the GCF. It is concluded that the epithelium is an important and probably the prime source of gingival prostaglandin production and that proinflammatory cytokines that regulate PGHS-2 which are induced by locally present micro-organisms are the likely stimulus for its production. Inhibitors of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ biosynthesis such as NSAIDs can block the production of serine and neutral proteinases $[14,17]$ as a result of their inhibition of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ biosynthesis. If elevated concentrations of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ found in GCF of patients experiencing clinical attachment loss is a reflection of the underlying pathology, then the use of topically applied NSAIDs at the site of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ production (i.e. the gingival epithelium) appears to be a rational and effective approach for the treatment and prevention of periodontitis.
