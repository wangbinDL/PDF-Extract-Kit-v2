#### Abstract

The IR spectra of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass samples containing known amounts of oxygen $\left(4 \times 10^{-3}\right.$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-2}$ wt $\%)$ or carbon ( $\leq 5.8 \times 10^{-3}$ wt $\%)$ are measured, and the parameters of impurity-related absorption bands and extinction coefficients are determined. The effects of oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen on the transmission of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass are analyzed. At an oxygen content on the order of $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$, this impurity causes optical losses in the range $900-1100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ comparable to the intrinsic losses. The permissible carbon content of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass is $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$. Carbon inclusions $0.07 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter cause optical losses comparable to the intrinsic losses in the spectral window of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass when present in a concentration of $\sim 10^{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.


 INTRODUCTION
The mid-IR transmission of glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ is sensitive to oxygen impurity, which is responsible for IR absorption bands near the long-wavelength transmission edge. In earlier studies [1-3], the positions of several impurity bands in the transmission spectrum of oxygen-doped As-Se glasses were determined, and some of those bands were identified. Quantitative data on oxygen-related absorption were reported for $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3.4}$ glass [3]. Such data for glass of stoichiometric composition $\left(\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}\right)$ would allow one to confirm the assignment of impurity bands, to more accurately determine the state of oxygen, and to evaluate the extinction coefficient of the glass.
The effect of carbon impurity on the IR spectra of $\mathrm{As}-$ Se glasses has not yet been studied in sufficient detail. Borisevich et al. [4] described absorption bands due to carbon compounds in glassy Se. Such data for glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ are not available in the literature. Earlier [5], experiments on chemical vapor transport of carbon in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ vapor from a high-temperature to low-temperature zone revealed a restricted carbon solubility in molten arsenic selenide.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of oxygen and carbon impurities on the optical transmission of glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$. To this end, we measured the IR transmission spectra of samples containing known levels of oxygen and carbon.

## EXPERIMENTAL

Glassy arsenic selenide was prepared by melting high-purity arsenic and selenium at $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an evacuated quartz tube introduced into a rocking muffle furnace, followed by furnace-cooling $\left(1-3^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}\right)$. The resultant glass ingots were 11 mm in diameter and 160 mm in length. The IR transmission spectra of glass samples up to 15 mm thick showed no impurity absorption bands in the range $350-4000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. The carbon content of the glass, as determined by reaction gas chromatography, was within 0.2 ppm by weight. The concentration of second-phase inclusions determined by laser ultramicroscopy [5] was $1.6 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, and their diameter was $0.06-0.10 \mu \mathrm{m}$. The metal and silicon contents were determined by optical emission spectroscopy $(0.1-1 \mathrm{ppm})$.

Glass samples containing known amounts of oxygen were prepared as described previously [3]. A glass ingot (with known levels of impurities and secondphase inclusions and a known IR absorption spectrum) was placed in a quartz tube which was then filled with oxygen to a preset pressure and sealed off. As a result, the tube contained known amounts of arsenic selenide and oxygen gas. The tube was mounted in a furnace and heated to $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to homogenize the melt.

As shown earlier [3], the oxygen that was not incorporated into the $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ melt formed cubic $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ in the vapor phase. The oxide was condensed at the opposite end of the tube, and its amount was determined gravi-

metrically. We also prepared a control sample by the same procedure but without introducing oxygen into the tube. The amount of oxygen in the doped samples was evaluated as the difference between the amount of oxygen introduced into the tube and that present in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. In this way, we obtained a series of samples with an oxygen content from $4 \times 10^{-3}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \%$. The estimated error of determination was typically within $10 \%$. Analysis of the samples containing $4 \times 10^{-3}$ to $2.2 \times 10^{-2}$ wt $\% \mathrm{O}$ on a laser tandem reflectron mass spectrometer confirmed the calculated oxygen contents, as illustrated in Fig. 1, which compares gravimetry ( $C_{1}$ ) and mass spectrometry ( $C_{2}$ ) data.

Carbon was introduced into arsenic selenide as described in [5]. A sample of high-purity glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ was situated in the bottom part of an evacuated quartz tube, and a silica glass crucible containing a graphite (OSCh 7-4) rod was secured in the upper part of the tube. The temperature in the zone of the graphite rod was $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and molten $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ was maintained at $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Carbon and the $\mathrm{Se}_{2}$ molecules resulting from the dissociative $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ vaporization reacted according to the schemes [5]

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}(s)+1 / 2 \mathrm{Se}_{2}(g) \rightleftarrows \mathrm{Se}(g) \\
& \mathrm{C}(s)+\mathrm{Se}_{2}(g) \rightleftarrows \mathrm{Se}_{2}(g)
\end{aligned}
$$

The forward reactions (1) and (2) are endothermic, which ensures vapor transport of carbon from the hightemperature to the low-temperature zone. The reaction time was varied from 4 to 32 h . In a control experiment, run under the same conditions for 8 h , the tube contained no graphite. After air cooling, the glass samples were analyzed for total carbon and submicron-sized second-phase inclusions.
In optical studies, we used plane-parallel plates 1 to 10 mm thick, with their faces polished to optical finish. Transmission spectra were measured in the range $350-$ $5000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in vacuum with a Bruker IFS-113v Fourier transform IR spectrometer and were then converted into absorption spectra with allowance made for the sample thickness. The homogeneity of the impurity distribution was checked by measuring the IR absorption spectra of samples cut from the upper and lower portions of the ingot. The spectra showed no variations in absorption with position in the ingot.

## EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the IR absorption spectra (400$1400 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) of oxygen-doped $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass samples in comparison with the control sample.

Table 1 lists the carbon contents and the concentrations of $0.06-$ to $0.17-\mu \mathrm{m}$ second-phase inclusions in the $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass samples prepared through chemical vapor transport. The IR absorption spectra of the carbon-doped and control samples are displayed in Fig. 3.

## DISCUSSION

The IR absorption spectra in Figs. 2 and 3 clearly demonstrate that doping with oxygen and carbon reduces the IR transmission of the glass (compared to both the parent glass and control samples). Oxygen doping gives rise to prominent absorption bands in the range $400-1400 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and carbon doping produces additional bands in the range $850-1700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$.

Composite bands were unfolded into individual components as described in [6]:

$$
I(\nu)=\sum_{k=1}^{n} I_{k}(\nu)
$$

Here, $I(\nu)$ is the integrated intensity of a composite band, $I_{k}(\nu)$ is the integrated intensity of the $k$ th symmetrical band, and $n$ is the number of symmetrical bands.

The bands were fitted by Voigt line shapes,

The intensity (absorption coefficient) was determined with an accuracy of 7-10\%.

The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The width and shape of the individual components were independent of impurity content, as were their peak positions (to within $3-5 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ).

The set of impurity bands in the oxygen-doped $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass differed very little from that in the

Se-enriched glass As ${ }_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3.4}$ [3]. For most of the impurity bands, the peak position, assignment, and other parameters were the same in the spectra of the two glasses. The only distinction was that the weak feature at $904 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which was assigned earlier to the $\mathrm{Se}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds in glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3.4}$, was lacking in the present spectra.

Figure 4 illustrates two types of variations of the impurity absorption coefficient with total oxygen content in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass. At oxygen levels above $1.5 \times$ $10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \%$, we obtain straight lines for the bands due to absorption in glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ (by $\mathrm{AsO}_{3 / 2}$ structural units) (e.g., the bands at 503, 805, 633, and $650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ), as in an earlier study [3]. The intensity of the bands due to $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules (e.g., those peaked at 482 and $790 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) ceases to increase between $4.0 \times 10^{-2}$ and $4.8 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \%$ O. The extinction coefficients for each of the impurity bands were determined from the linear portions of the plots and are close to the data for glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3.4}$ (Table 4). These data refer to the total oxygen content of the glass, rather than to particular species, and give, therefore, effective extinction coefficients.

The assignment of the impurity bands and the observed variation of the absorption coefficient with oxygen content (deviation from the Lambert-Beer law) can be accounted for by the presence of a few oxide species in the glass [3]. In the range $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$ to $7.7 \times$ $10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{O}$, these are $\mathrm{AsO}_{3 / 2}$ groups, forming the glass network of arsenic oxide, and $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules. At oxygen contents below $1.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \%$ (the concentration range which was not studied in [3]), the variation of the absorption coefficient with oxygen content deviates from linearity. Two types of such variations are illustrated in Fig. 5 for the strongest bands (650 and $790 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ). As seen in Fig. 5, our results agree well with the data obtained by Moynihan et al. [2], who reported that, at low oxygen levels in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass, oxygen was present mainly in the form of $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules (oxide species I) and oxygen atoms substituting for Se in the $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass network (oxide species II). Species I and II are responsible for the absorptions at 790 and $650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively. The other bands observed in this concentration range can be divided into two groups according to the variation in their intensity. One group comprises the bands at $482,503,805,937,995,1050$, 1265, and $1340 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, attributable to species I. This assignment is supported by the fact that the IR spectrum of arsenolite, consisting of $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules, shows bands close in frequency to those above: 480, 500, 800$805,938,985,1050$, and $1265 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}[7-10]$. The other group includes the bands at 965 and $1125 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, arising from species II. Their frequencies correspond to the absorption bands of glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}[8,10]$.

The observed variation of the absorption coefficient with total oxygen content suggests that the relative amounts of oxide species also depend on oxygen content. Below $1.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{O}$, isolated oxygen atoms incorporated into the glass network and dissolved $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules prevail. At higher oxygen levels, structural components of glassy arsenic oxide appear: polymeric layers of $\mathrm{AsO}_{3 / 2}$ units. Glassy arsenic oxide results from gradual oxygen substitution for selenium

(with the formation of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3-x} \mathrm{O}_{x}$ units in intermediate steps) and $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ polymerization. That the intensity of the $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$-related bands ceases to grow (Fig. 4) suggests that this species is an intermediate product of polymerization. Changes in the relative amounts of oxide species are also evidenced by the observed shifts of composite bands. In particular, increasing the oxygen content of the glass shifts the band at $650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to $635 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Fig. 2) owing to the increase in the intensity of the $633-\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ component compared to the $650-\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ component. Similarly, the $950-\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ band shifts to $940 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ with increasing oxygen content (Fig. 2). These findings provide clear evidence that the relative amounts of oxide species in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass depend on the total oxygen content.

It follows from the data in Table 1 that chemical vapor transport of carbon in the form of CSe or $\mathrm{CSe}_{2}$ can be used as a process for the introduction of carbon into molten arsenic selenide since the total carbon content increases by more than one order of magnitude compared to both the parent glass and control sample. Carbon is present in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ in several forms, including submicron-sized second-phase inclusions. Their concentration in doped samples is an order of magnitude higher than that in the parent glass and control sample

In addition, some of the second-phase inclusions may consist of silica, as suggested by the higher silicon content (by a factor of 2.5) and higher concentration of inclusions in the control sample compared to the parent glass (Table 1). We also observe an increase in absorption in the range 900$1100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Fig. 3), where bands due to $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ vibrations may appear [11]. It seems likely, however, that most particles consist primarily of carbon. The particle concentration in the control sample differs from that in the sample held in the presence of a graphite rod for the same time (Table 1, samples 2, 6) by almost a factor of 7, indicating that the main contribution to the formation of foreign particles in the melt comes from the reaction between selenium vapor and carbon, followed by CSe and $\mathrm{CSe}_{2}$ decomposition in the low-temperature zone [5]. Our results also indicate that carbon solubility in molten $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ at $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is no higher than $10^{-3} \mathrm{wt} \%$.

Note: Extinction coefficients and assignment for the concentration range $1.5 \times 10^{-2}-7.7 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{O}$.

The preparation of glass samples with a relatively high carbon content, up to $5.8 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{wt} \%$, made it possible to reveal selective absorption bands in their IR spectra. By unfolding composite bands, we were able to identify individual components and determine their parameters (Table 3). The components at 895 and $1275 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are assignable to C-Se vibrations given that the spectrum of carbon diselenide contains bands centered at 902 and $1275 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. The other absorptions are most likely due to $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds.

The extinction coefficients for individual carbonrelated absorptions are difficult to evaluate from the present data because the relative amounts of carboncontaining species, necessary for such evaluation, are unknown. The nonuniqueness of the relationship between the total carbon content and band intensities in the spectra of doped samples indicates that the predominant carbon-containing species is determined not only by reactions (1) and (2). Nevertheless, the present results can be used to estimate the carbon content leading to a preset level of optical losses in the spectral window of glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$. The optical losses through the scattering and absorption by carbon inclusions in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass were evaluated using earlier data on the spectral characteristics of soot particles close in carbon content to $100 \%$ [12]. In the peak-transmission range of $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass $(5-6 \mu \mathrm{m})$, the additional losses will not exceed the intrinsic losses at a concentration of

$0.07-\mu \mathrm{m}$ particles below $10^{4} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. The concentration of larger sized particles must be even lower. Calculations from the spectra of samples 2 and 5 in Fig. 3, which show the highest impurity absorption level, give the following estimates for the extinction coefficient of carbon impurity: $6 \times 10^{3}$ and $1.3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~dB} /(\mathrm{m} \mathrm{wt} \%)$ in the range $1250-1700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $7 \times 10^{3}$ and $2.8 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~dB} /(\mathrm{m} \mathrm{wt} \%)$ in the range $850-1150 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ for samples 2 and 5 , respectively. In this spectral region, the loss level comparable to the intrinsic losses in glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ can be reached at carbon contents from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$.

Figure 6 shows the spectral dependences of the extinction coefficient for oxygen, hydrogen ( $\mathrm{Se}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds ), and sulfur impurities in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass. As seen, oxygen and sulfur impurities have a significant effect on the long-wavelength transmission of the glass, while hydrogen influences its short-wavelength transmission.
Using quantitative impurity absorption data, one can evaluate the permissible impurity concentrations in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass with a preset optical loss level. For example, the oxygen-related losses will not exceed the intrinsic loss level in the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ lasing range ( $900-1100 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) at oxygen contents in glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ within $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$. The results of such calculations can be used to formulate requirements on the purity of glassy arsenic selenide for optical fibers.

## CONCLUSIONS

Oxygen impurities are present in $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ glass in the form of several species: $\mathrm{As}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ molecules, polymeric glassy arsenic oxide, and isolated oxygen atoms substituting for Se in the glass network.

The relative amounts of these species and, accordingly, the relative intensities of the corresponding IR absorption bands depend on the total oxygen content.

Carbon impurities are present in the form of atomic groups, which give rise to selective absorption bands in the range $850-1700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and second-phase inclusions, which increase the scattering and absorption losses.

It follows from the present results that, at oxygen and carbon contents below $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$, these impurities have an insignificant effect on the optical transmission of glassy $\mathrm{As}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$.
