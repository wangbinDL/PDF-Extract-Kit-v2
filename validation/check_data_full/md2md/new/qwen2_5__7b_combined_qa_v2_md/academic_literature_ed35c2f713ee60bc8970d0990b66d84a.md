#### Abstract

Polycrystalline $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ was synthesized from commercially available and additionally purified $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se . As shown by chemical analysis, the material prepared from as-purchased reagents exhibited significant deviations from stoichiometry. According to microstructural analysis, this material contained a second phase. $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ synthesized from additionally purified $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se was uniform in composition. The highest degree of purification was ensured by the Bridgman-Stockbarger method, which enabled growth of stoichiometric single crystals. Attempts to purify $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ by directional solidification, zone melting, and thermal evaporation led to decomposition of the material. According to mass spectrometry results, the major products of $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ decomposition are $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}, \mathrm{Ga}_{2} \mathrm{Se}, \mathrm{Pb}$, and $\mathrm{Se}_{2}$.


## INTRODUCTION

$\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$, a IV-III2-VI4 compound existing in the $\mathrm{PbSe}-\mathrm{Ga}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$ join of the ternary system $\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{Ga}-\mathrm{Se}$, is commonly prepared as described by Eholie et al. [1], who melted stoichiometric mixtures of $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se in silica tubes sealed off under vacuum. They obtained dense black ingots of composition $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ as determined by chemical analysis. $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystallizes in orthorhombic symmetry with lattice parameters $a=$ $10.64 \AA, b=10.77 \AA$, and $c=6.539 \AA$.

The purpose of this work is to study the behavior of $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}, \mathrm{Se}$, and impurities during the synthesis and purification of polycrystalline $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ and crystal growth. Data are also presented on the dissolution kinetics and temperature-dependent vaporization behavior of $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystals.

## EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS

Polycrystalline $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ was synthesized by a tw-zone process: Se was maintained at $700-750{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and Pb and Ga , at $750-800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The synthesis duration was 4860 h for a sample weight of 0.3 kg . The highest temperature was $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The synthesized material was homogenized at $750 \pm 1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $24-30 \mathrm{~h}$ and then furnacecooled. The temperature of the furnaces was stabilized to within $\pm 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ using VRT-2 precision temperature controllers.

The material was characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural analysis, and differential thermal analysis (DTA), and its composition was determined by chemical analysis.

The XRD pattern of $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ could be indexed in an orthorhombic cell with $a=10.638 \AA, b=10.766 \AA$, and $c=6.357 \AA$, in agreement with earlier results [1].

Etching with a $1: 3$ mixture of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ revealed a second phase, which was identified as carbon by careful microstructural examination. The sources of carbon were bituminous impurities in selenium. The polycrystalline material was analyzed for $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se .
Pb was determined by titration with Trilon B in an acetate buffer solution at pH 5 in the presence of Xylenol Orange as the indicator (relative error of determination, $0.2-0.7 \%$ ) [2].
Ga was determined by chelatometric titration, with PAN as the indicator (relative error of determination, $0.7-0.9 \%$ ) [3].
Se was determined spectrophotometrically in the form of a complex with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (relative error of determination, $0.6-1.2 \%$ ) [4].

Polycrystalline $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ was Se -deficient, as determined by chemical analysis: the Se content was found to be $43.35 \mathrm{wt} \%$, against the nominal value of $47.68 \mathrm{wt} \%$. Se losses were also observed earlier in the synthesis of $\mathrm{CdGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{CuAlSe}_{2}$ [5, 6]. In all cases, deviations from stoichiometry were associated with the use of as-purchased selenium. The Pb and Ga contents of $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ also differed from the stoichiometric values (Table 1).

These results suggest that, to obtain high-purity $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystals, commercially available $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se must be purified further.



Table 1. Chemical analysis data (wt \%) for polycrystalline and singe-crystal $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$

| Sample | $\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{V} 000$ grade) | $\mathrm{Ga}(\mathrm{OSCh}$ V000) | Se (OSCh 17-4) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |

$\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{V} 000)$ grade) was purified by acid etching, hightemperature heat treatment, and zone melting, which reduced the total impurity content to $10^{-5} \div 10^{-7} \mathrm{wt} \%$. $\mathrm{Ga}(\mathrm{OSCh}$ V000) was purified by acid etching and high-temperature vacuum heat treatment. The total impurity content after purification was at a level of $10^{-5} \mathrm{wt} \%$. The Cd and Hg contents were below the corresponding detection limits.

Se (OSCh 17-4) was purified by acid etching, vacuum distillation, directional solidification, and zone melting, which reduced the concentrations of major impurities by two to three orders of magnitude and the carbon concentration to below the detection limit.

The polycrystalline growth charge synthesized from the additionally purified $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se was phase-pure by XRD. Microstructural examination revealed no carbon. It was more uniform in composition compared to the charge prepared from as-purchased $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se (Table 1).

Attempts were made to further purify this material by directional solidification, zone melting, and the Bridgman-Stockbarger method. In the first two purification processes, $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ decomposed according to the scheme

$$
\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSe}+\mathrm{Ga}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}
$$

The products, both PbSe and $\mathrm{Ga}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{3}$, had nonstoichiometric compositions.
$\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystals were grown by the BridgmanStockbarger method in silica ampules pumped down to $0.1-0.01 \mathrm{~Pa}$. The solidification rate was $0.1-0.5 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$, and the temperature gradient was $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mm}$.

Preliminary results on the purification of the $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ charge by crystallization indicated that increasing the free space in the ampule led to partial $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ decomposition. In view of this, in growing $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystals by the Bridgman-Stockbarger method, the free space in the ampules was minimized (10-20\%).

In this way, we obtained black ingots similar in shape to the ampules, with a convex upper part. This shape was favorable for driving impurities from the central part of the ingot to its periphery. Indeed, the surface layer that was in contact with silica was found to contain gas inclusions 2 to $3 \mu \mathrm{m}$ in size and $4 \times 10^{-2}$ to $7 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{wt} \%$ Si. As shown by XRD, microstructural examination, and chemical analysis, the ingots were single-crystalline.

The crystals prepared using as-purchased $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se had nonstoichiometric compositions. The deviation from stoichiometry was smaller in the neck (Table 1).

Those crystals exhibited cleavage in the basal plane, breaking into several parts, which indicated that impurities resided predominantly in the gaps between the layers and that the crystals were structurally imperfect (Table 2). The highest purity was achieved in the middle portion of the ingots, which contained $\mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{As}, \mathrm{Ti}$, and other impurities.

The $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ crystals prepared using purified Pb , Ga, and Se had nearly stoichiometric compositions (Table 1) and displayed good cleavage properties parallel to the basal plane. The middle (highest purity) portion of the crystals contained evenly distributed Tl and In impurities. In the upper part of the ingots, the major impurities were $\mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Al}, \mathrm{Cd}, \mathrm{As}, \mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{Zn}$, and Mn (Table 2).

According to DTA results, the melting points of the polycrystalline $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ growth charges prepared from as-purchased and additionally purified $\mathrm{Pb}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Se were $778 \pm 5$ and $786 \pm 5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, respectively. The $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ melt solidified after supercooling, which attained 34 and $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the growth charges prepared from as-purchased and additionally purified chemicals, respectively.

The dissolution behavior of single-crystal $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ was studied in inorganic and organic solvents (Table 3). The highest dissolution rate was observed in concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$. With decreasing $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ concentration, the dissolution rate of $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ decreases. Increasing the temperature accelerates $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ dissolution in nitric acid. In benzene and concentrated $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}, \mathrm{HCl}$, and $\mathrm{KOH}, \mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ dissolves only partially. $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ solubility in $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, acetic acid, toluene, acetone, ethanol, and Trilon B is insignificant.

Vaporization $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ single crystals was studied using an MI-1201 mass spectrometer fitted with a bandsized ion source for analysis of solids [7]. In the gas source, one of the cathodes was replaced by an effusion cell. The crystals were vaporized from tantalum Knudsen cells in the range $600-1300 \mathrm{~K}$.

Since mass spectra depend on the ionizing-electron energy, we measured the ionization efficiency curves of the forming ions in order to identify the ions and major vapor species (Fig. 1). From the initial portion of the curves, we determined the appearance potentials of the ions by linear extrapolation. The major vapor species were identified by comparing the fusion and ionization potentials. Calibration was performed against the appearance potential of $\mathrm{Hg}(10.4 \mathrm{eV})$.

According to the present experimental results, $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ vaporizes quantitatively starting at 950 Krikh. Below 1070 K , the dominant vapor species is $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}$. At higher temperatures, the vapor phase also contains $\mathrm{Ga}_{2} \mathrm{Se}, \mathrm{Se}_{2}$, and Pb . In addition, the mass spectrum shows signals from $\mathrm{Ga}, \mathrm{Ga}_{2}, \mathrm{Se}$, and $\mathrm{GaSe}_{2}$, due to dis-

From the temperature-dependent ion currents for the major vapor species (Fig. 2), we evaluated their partial heats of vaporization $[8,9]$.

## CONCLUSIONS

The present results demonstrate that, to obtain homogeneous, high-purity $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2} \mathrm{Se}_{4}$ growth charges and crystals, high-purity starting chemicals and optimized synthesis and growth procedures are required.
