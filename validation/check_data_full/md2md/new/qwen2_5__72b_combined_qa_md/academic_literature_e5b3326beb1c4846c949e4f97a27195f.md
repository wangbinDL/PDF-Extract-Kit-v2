# AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE TEACHING OF CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES 

MARY G. KELTY<br>Chicago, Illinois<br>NELLE E. MOORE<br>Supervisor of Elementary Education, Wilmette, Illinois

In the period during and immediately following the World War, great interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in the schools. Many junior and senior high schools experimented with various methods and materials in current events and adopted some definite program, either providing special classes in the subject or making specific correlation with history, civics, or oral English. Few suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the elementary schools have occasionally been put forward, but these suggestions have not been given serious consideration. The general feeling seems to have been that children in the elementary-grades are too immature, their background of information too restricted, and their reading ability too limited to warrant the expectation that they might be able to understand present-day problems.

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades. After several semesters many of them gave up the attempt, finding the available materials to be unsuited for the use of younger children. Others have continued the study during one reading period a week, even though they did not feel fully satisfied with the existing conditions. Few of them, however, so far as the writers are aware, have attempted to measure results or to present evidence as to the children's understanding or interest.

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in education. The results of the great improvement in silent reading and study habits beginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire field of

school system, especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children used to read some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of new materials is being keenly felt. At the same time there has been attempted in the social sciences a very genuine and widespread organization of materials, with the objective of choosing subject-matter and activities in line with social values and life-situations. Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience as possible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom. Valuable allies for such an attempt are now furnished by the news reels in the motion-picture houses and by the rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers, both of which are usually available to elementary-school children throughout the country.

Like all other students of the social sciences, the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investigate their effects on the ability of middle-grade children to read current events. Most opportunely, an invitation came to them to undertake for a period of two years, ending in June, i93I, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.

The first problem was the setting-up of an educational program. It was obvious that materials chosen for young children should be subjected to a double test: (i) accuracy and (2) suitability to children's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.

# GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 

I. [Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourthgrade work.] Most fourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.




---

2. A complete résumé of the news of the world is unsuited to the interests and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades. Topics should be fully selected, and only a few should be presented at one time.
3. A variety of interests should be built up-political, geographic, economic, mechanical, artistic, scientific, etc. Foreign news should receive as much attention as domestic news.
4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an important phase of world-news. It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding. A few other short articles (perhaps two to four) may deal with other selected topics.
5. When feasible, the leading articles may well alternate foreign and domestic news. They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.
6. In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly constituted a leading article.
7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appearance in a current-events paper. The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.
8. Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to current events, the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour a week.
9. Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers produced for adults, the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.
Io. Children's information can be tested. Their interest in the materials, however, can best be judged by their classroom teachers.

# The Conducting of the Experiment 

From the outset the experiment faced a serious difficulty in connection with the physical makeup of the paper. The fact that the sheets were only $5 \frac{1}{2}$ by $8 \frac{1}{2}$ inches in size necessitated the use of very small type, which seriously impaired the value of the few pictures that were included. The results secured were attained in spite of the almost prohibitive appearance of the paper. Teachers were helped to make the assigned reading more interesting, however, by a sheet on "The Reading of Current Events," which was sent out at the beginning of the experiment.

Each weekly issue contained a leading article, from four to six shorter articles, and an entire page devoted to tests and activities. The tests were informal objective tests on the leading article. The "activities" suggested things to do, to talk about, to think about, and to read about, in order to increase the children's interest and to develop understanding.

All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grade use. They also followed the reactions of several groups of children to the different types of materials that were presented week by week. At the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the test program might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of ten publishing houses the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children in grades four, five, and six were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to administer the weekly tests, record their results on a tabulation sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. Approximately two thirds of the teachers reported for one, two, or three terms but did not complete the entire year. These schools represented large cities, small towns, and rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations. The publishers also generously co-operated in printing and distributing the record sheets.

In addition to a tabulation of the test results, the teachers were asked to furnish the following information.

# To Be Filled out at the End of Nine Weeks 

## VOTE OF CHILDREN

I. To the Teacher: Ask the children to write the answers to the following questions and, in the blanks below, fill in the names of the stories receiving the highest votes with the reason most generally given.
A. Which of the front-page stories that you have read in the Numbers 1 to 9, inclusive, do you like best? (Look back in your book if you do not remember the names of the front-page stories.)

Name of story
Why did you like it best?
B. Which second best?

Name of story Why did you like it?
C. Which third best?

Name of story
Why did you like it?
II. Ask the children to write "yes" or "no" in answer to the following question. Names need not be signed.

Does your family take a daily newspaper?
A weekly newspaper?
${ }^{x}$ It was soon evident that classes in current events were unsuitable for most fourth grades.

## THE FINDINGS

In order that the reader may understand the type of current events material used in the study, the titles of the first ten stories in each of the four nine-week periods are given in Table I. The classifications into political, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the stories.

A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices of news stories in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. The stories of domestic news ranked first, second, or third in the choices of these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received similar honors. Seven of the favorite stories are classified as political, five are classified as geographical, and three as economic.

The choices of these children seem to indicate that few fifth and sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and domestic news. Frequent repetition of names and places in the current

and that they have greater interest in the important phases of the news than has been commonly believed by teachers and administrators.

NUMBER OF STORIES

| CLASSIFICATION OF STORIES | First <br> Choice | Second <br> Choice | Third <br> Choice |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Foreign: |  |  |  |
| Political and historical. | 1 | 2 | I |

| Political and historical. | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Geographical. | 1 | 1 | 1 |

Table III shows the types of illustrations which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories were used in the experiment. Of the thirty-five, had no front-page illustrations. This fact may be attached to the fact that fourteen of the stories chosen as first, second, or third choices had front-page illustrations.

While this study secured no data as to the actual size of the middle-grade newspaper from the point of view of size of the page, it is the impression of the experimenters that a larger paper is imperative. A larger paper with larger type, of course, would cost much more than the middle-grade papers now available, and no commercial firm can be blamed for not bringing out a paper on the market unless the schools can guarantee a sale. The publication of such a paper would appear to be possible only through subsidizing by a foundation interested in education.

An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of the middle-grade newspaper through objective tests-true-false, multiple-choice, and completion of outlines. A comparison of the results of the three types of tests gave rise to some interesting conclusions relative to the ease of reading as shown by these tests.

cording to choices shows little or no relation between choice of test and ease of reading. However, the scores of the pupils on all the other tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the stories had been understood by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores were consistently made on the true-false and the multiple-choice types of tests, the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were determined by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading the stories. Table IV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.

The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families take daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take daily papers and that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent take weekly papers. Teachers reported that about 50 per cent of the pupils gave evidence of reading newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting bits of information to the class.

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to language difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the language suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of material in the News Outline was sufficient to serve the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.

# CONCLUSIONS 

The data seem to justify the following conclusions. (1) News in important world-news of a variety of types, including political, historical, geographical, economic, and social, can be successfully presented to fifth- and sixth-grade pupils. (2) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can read world-news intelligently if it is presented to themin proper explanations and in language suitable for young people. (3) It seems probable that classroom use of a current-events periodical introduces pupils to important phases of world-news enduring in character, stimulates the reading of newspapers outside of class and serves as a guide to that reading. (4) Attractive illustrations influence pupil interest in stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including enough material for a thirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the demands made upon it by teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
