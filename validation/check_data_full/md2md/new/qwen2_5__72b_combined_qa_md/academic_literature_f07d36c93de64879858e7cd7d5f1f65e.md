#### Abstract

Previous evidence has shown that the majority of the interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR is associated with ribosomes in vivo. Here we show that ribosomes are inhibitory for PKR activity since they compete with dsRNA for binding to PKR, inhibit the activation of the protein kinase by dsRNA, and prevent the phosphorylation of the PKR substrate eIF2 $\alpha \alpha$. We suggest that ribosomes constitute a reservoir of inactive PKR and that the protein kinase must be displaced from the ribosome by dsRNA in order to become activated.

## 1. Introduction

The interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)dependent protein kinase PKR is an important factor for the regulation of protein synthesis in response to viral infections and following exposure of uninfected cells to a variety of physiological stresses [1,2]. In both animal and plant systems PKR is activated by viral dsRNA or by stem-loop structures in mRNAs [3-5] in a process which involves dimerisation and autophosphorylation of the enzyme (reviewed in [6]). In infected cells PKR plays an important role in the antiviral effects of the interferons by inhibiting protein synthesis due to the phosphorylation of the $\alpha$ subunit of polypeptide chain initiation factor eIF2 [1]. In uninfected cells PKR is activated by stress conditions such as high cell density, growth factor deprivation or mobilisation of calcium by the ionophore A23187 [7-9]. The kinase is also involved in the regulation of cell growth. The wild-type form inhibits cell proliferation, whereas inactive mutant forms can transform cells to a tumorigenic phenotype [10-12]. Several mutants have a dominant negative effect on the wild-type enzyme in mammalian cells and in transfected yeast strains [13], as well as in vitro [14,15]. Other studies have shown that additional inhibitors of PKR activity, such as the protein p58IPK and the cellular TAR binding protein, also transform cells when these proteins are over-expressed $[16,17]$.

PKR is a relatively abundant protein, at least in some cell types. We have previously estimated that it is present in human Daudi cells at a level approximately equal to $20 \%$ of that of ribosomes [18]. After interferon treatment this increases to a concentration that is roughly equimolar with ribosomes. Moreover, cellular fractionation studies indicate that the majority of the protein kinase is associated with ribosomes in the cell, at least prior to interferon treatment [18]. Zhu et al. [19] have shown that, in a yeast expression system, PKR binds to

[^0]40 S ribosomal subunits independently of mRNA and have produced evidence, based on mutagenesis studies, that the dsRNA binding motifs in the N -terminal part of the protein are required for the ability of the protein to bind to ribosomes. In view of this data it is possible that the ribosome itself plays a role in the regulation of PKR activation or activity, but no previous studies have addressed this question. Here we have investigated the strength of binding of PKR to ribosomes, the ability of ribosomes to influence PKR-dsRNA interactions, and the effect of ribosomes on the protein kinase activity of PKR in vitro.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Materials

The synthetic dsRNA poly(I) $\cdot$ poly(C) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in 50 mM KCl . $\left[\gamma^{-3} \mathrm{P}\right]$ ATP was obtained from ICN Biomedical and ECL kits for immunoblotting were purchased from Amersham. A monoclonal antibody specific for human PKR (MAb 71/10) [20] was a kind gift from Drs A. Hovanessian and E. Meurs (Paris).

### 2.2. Preparation of ribosomes

Ribosomes were prepared from HeLa cells by lysing the cells in low salt buffer ( 20 mM HEPES, pH $7.4,10 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 1.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}{ }_{2}$, 1 mM DTT) containing protease inhibitors ( 1 mM PMSF, $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ pepstatin A and $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at $30000 \times g$ for 20 min followed by $504000 \times g$ for 70 min . The pelleted ribosomes from the latter centrifugation were resuspended in RB buffer (10 mM Tris- $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{pH}, 7.5,80 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 1.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$ ). These conditions retain associated proteins on the ribosomes. Alternatively, ribosomes were resuspended in 10 mM Tris- $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5,900 \mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{KCl}, 5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}{ }_{2}$ to remove all ribosome-associated proteins, centrifuged through a cushion of 0.5 M sucrose in the same buffer and resuspended in RB buffer. The salt-washed ribosomes were stored in aliquots at $-70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

### 2.3. Preparation of $P K R$

Enzymatically active wild-type PKR was prepared from rabbit liver ribosomal salt wash by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and FPLC Mono-S columns as described previously [21]. The PKR thus obtained was dependent on dsRNA for activation and was free of other detectable protein kinase activities. A PKR point mutant (K296R) was also purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus (a gift from Dr M. Katze, University of Washington) [14]. This form of the enzyme has no protein kinase activity but retains normal RNA binding properties [22].

### 2.4. Immunoblotting

The amount of PKR associated with ribosomes was determined by centrifugation of incubations at $436000 \times g$ for 60 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, followed by resuspension of the pellets in SDS gel sample buffer. Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described pre-

viously [18], using the monoclonal antibody against human PKR. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and an ECL kit (Amersham).

### 2.5. Preparation of labelled dsRNA

A radioactive 940 bp dsRNA species was prepared by in vitro symmetrical transcription of exon 2 of the mouse c-myc gene using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases for synthesis of the two respective strands, as described previously [23]. The strand transcribed by T7 polymerase was radioactively labelled by inclusion of $\left[\alpha^{-3}\right.$ P]UTP in the transcription mix. The two strands were annealed to produce the radioactive dsRNA, which had a specific radioactivity of $1.5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{cpm} / \mu \mathrm{g}$.

### 2.6. Filter binding assays

Formation of complexes between PKR and dsRNA was assessed by retention of radioactivity in ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$-labelled c-myc dsRNA on cellulose nitrate filters. The labelled RNA was incubated with PKR in $25 \mu 1$ reaction volumes for 15 min at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the presence of 10 mM Tris$\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{pH} 7.5,75 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 0.8 \mathrm{mM}$ Mg acetate and $200 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ bovine serum albumin. To terminate the reactions, samples were added to $100 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of wash buffer (containing the same ionic components as the incubation mix) and were immediately filtered under gentle suction. The filters were washed with $4 \times 200 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of wash buffer, dried and the radioactivity counted in a scintillation counter.

### 2.7. Phosphorylation assays and phosphorimaging

PKR activity was determined by an autophosphorylation assay as described previously $[23,24]$. Purified wild-type kinase (from rabbit liver) was incubated with [ $\left.\gamma^{3} \mathrm{P}\right]$ ATP ( $10^{\mu} \mathrm{Ci}$ ), in the presence or absence of the poly(I)/poly(C) activator $(0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml})$, in autophosphorylation buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, $100 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 2 \mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{MnCl}_{2}, 2 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}, 0.1 \mathrm{mM}$ EDTA, $10 \%$ glycerol). The incubation volume was $20 \mu \mathrm{l}$. In some experiments 300 ng of purified recombinant elF2K [25] (a gift from Dr S. Kimball, University of Pennsylvania) was added as a substrate for PKR. Samples were analysed by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Binding of PKR to ribosomes

Several previous studies have shown that PKR associates with ribosomes both in vitro and in intact cells $[18,19,26]$, but no previous data have been published concerning the salt sensitivity of this binding. Fig. 1a illustrates that the association of PKR with ribosomes from HeLa cells is very stable since a salt concentration of 400 mM is required to remove approximately $50 \%$ of the protein kinase in vitro. Even at a KCl concentration of 800 mM the ribosomes are not completely depleted of endogenous PKR. Similarly, purified PKR is still able to reassociate with salt-washed ribosomes in vitro in the presence of high concentrations of salt, as shown in Fig. b.
Since the binding of RNA ligands to PKR is also stable under high salt conditions [27] strong association of the protein kinase with ribosomes would be consistent with previous evidence [19] for an interaction between one or both dsRNA binding motifs of PKR and a site on the 40 S subunit (perhaps a region of exposed double-stranded 18 S ribosomal RNA), independent of the presence or absence of ribosome-associated mRNA. In accordance with this suggestion, the synthetic dsRNA poly(I)/poly(C) can at least partially displace PKR from ribosomes, even under low salt conditions, as shown in Fig. 2a,b. (Note that the incomplete displacement of PKR by

Various concentrations of KCl were added to $10 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of ribosomes to give the final values indicated and the ribosomes were incubated on ice for 30 min . Following recovery by centrifugation the ribosomes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and PKR was detected by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The upper panel shows the autoradiogram of the ECL assay. Lane C contains $0.6 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of purified recombinant PKR as a positive control. The lower panel shows quantitation of the data by laser densitometry. $\mathbf{b}$ : Ribosomes were washed in high salt to remove endogenous PKR and $60 \mu \mathrm{g}$ were then incubated with $0.6 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of $\mathrm{PKR}\left(\mathrm{K}^{296} \mathrm{R}\right)$ for 15 min at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the presence of the concentrations of KCl indicated. The ribosomes were centrifuged through a 0.5 M sucrose cushion containing the same salt concentrations and then treated as in a. The lane labelled 'No PKR' shows the signal obtained with the salt-washed ribosomes alone. Lane C contains $0.25 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of purified recombinant PKR as a positive control.

Fig. 2. a, b: Inhibition by dsRNA of PKR binding to ribosomes. Salt-washed ribosomes from HeLa cells ( 20 pmol per $50 \mu$ l reaction) were incubated with $0.5 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of purified PKR (K296R) at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min in 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7.5 ), $75 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 1.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}{ }_{2}$, in the presence of $0,0.1,1$ and $10 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ of poly(I)/poly(C). The ribosomes were then pelleted through a 0.5 ml cushion of 0.5 M sucrose in the same buffer by centrifugation at $436000 \times g$ for 80 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a $15 \%$ SDS polyacrylamide gel. The gel was probed for PKR by immunoblotting (a) as described in Section 2. Panel b shows quantitation of the data by laser densitometry. c: Inhibition by ribosomes of dsRNA binding to PKR. C-myc dsRNA (105 cpm) was incubated in the presence or absence of 20 ng of purified PKR (K296R) with increasing concentrations of salt-washed ribosomes as indicated. After 15 min at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ the incubations were analysed for RNA-protein binding using a filter binding assay (Section 2). $\square$, total dsRNA bound; $\square$, dsRNA bound to ribosomes in the absence of PKR; ■, dsRNA bound to PKR (by difference). poly(I)/poly(C) is probably due to the high (non-limiting) amount of ribosomes required for technical reasons in such experiments.) Further evidence for competition between ribosomes and dsRNA for a common binding site on PKR is seen when the association of labelled dsRNA with the protein is measured in a filter binding assay. Fig. 2c shows that saltwashed ribosomes are able to inhibit the binding of dsRNA to the kinase in such an assay.

Purified wildtype PKR ( 600 ng ) was incubated with $\left[\gamma^{-32} \mathrm{P}\right]$ ATP in the presence or absence of dsRNA ( $0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ of poly(I)/poly(C)) and the various concentrations of salt-washed ribosomes indicated, under protein kinase assay conditions (Section 2). After 20 min at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ the reactions were stopped with $2 \times$ SDS gel sample buffer and analysed by $15 \%$ polyacrylamide SDS gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. a: Autophosphorylation. PKR, dsRNA and ribosomes were present as indicated. b: Quantitation of the extent of dsRNA-dependent autophosphorylation of PKR as a function of ribosome concentration, as determined by phosphorimager analysis.

other for PKR binding we have examined the functional effects of salt-washed ribosomes on the activation of the protein kinase in vitro. Fig. 3 shows that the well-established requirement for dsRNA for the autophosphorylation of PKR, which reflects the activation of the kinase, cannot be met by ribosomes instead. Moreover, ribosomes very effectively prevent the autophosphorylation of the protein kinase in the presence of an otherwise optimal concentration of poly(I)/poly(C). These data are consistent with the competition for binding noted above but indicate that only dsRNA can provide the necessary conditions for autophosphorylation of PKR.

The best characterised substrate of PKR is the $\alpha$ subunit of the polypeptide chain initiation factor eIF2, which is itself a ribosome-associated protein for at least part of its functional cycle during protein synthesis [28]. We have investigated whether ribosomes can interfere with the phosphorylation of eIF2 $\alpha$ by PKR which has been preactivated for 20 min in the presence of dsRNA. Fig. 4 indicates that this is indeed the case; the addition of increasing amounts of ribosomes resulted in a substantial drop in the ${ }^{32} \mathrm{P}$ labelling of eIF2 $\alpha$ in vitro.

Wildtype PKR was incubated with poly(I)/poly(C) $(0.1 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml})$ in the absence of ribosomes under protein kinase assay conditions; after 20 min at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ recombinant eIF2 $\alpha$ ( 300 ng ) and the indicated concentrations of ribosomes were added and incubation continued for another 10 min . Samples were analysed by SDS gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (a). b: Quantitation of the extent of eIF2 $\alpha$ phosphorylation as determined by phosphorimaging.



Fig. 5. A model for regulation of PKR by ribosomes before and after interferon treatment. a: Inactive ribosome-associated PKR. In the absence of interferon treatment PKR is present at a low level in the cell, and the majority of it is tightly bound to ribosomes. The inhibitory effect of the ribosome prevents the kinase from being activated by RNA species with minimal secondary structure and only a relatively weak affinity for PKR. b: Dimerisation and activation of ribosome-associated PKR. Ribosome-bound PKR can be displaced from the ribosome and activated by dsRNA species which have extensive secondary structure and a high affinity for PKR. Such molecules may include both ribosome-associated mRNA species (shown) and soluble dsRNA (e.g. viral transcripts) (not shown). c: Activation of soluble PKR. Following interferon treatment the level of PKR in the cell increases and a proportion may no longer be associated with ribosomes. This soluble PKR, in the absence of the constraining influence of the ribosome, may be more readily activated by cellular or viral dsRNAs. In all cases activation of PKR requires homodimerisation (although both molecules in the homodimer may not necessarily need to be in contact with the dsRNA), followed by autophosphorylation of the protein kinase.
