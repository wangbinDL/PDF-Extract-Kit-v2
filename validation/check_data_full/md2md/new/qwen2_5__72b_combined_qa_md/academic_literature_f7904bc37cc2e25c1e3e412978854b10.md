#### Abstract

Background: The pathogenesis of NSAID-induced enteropathy may involve dual inhibition of the cyclooxygenase ( 1 and 2 ) and a topical effect with sequential increased intestinal permeability, development of inflammation and ulcers. It has been suggested that nitric-oxide donating drugs cause significantly less gastrointestinal injury by counteracting for NSAID-induced reductions in blood flow. Aims: To compare the effects of AZD3582 [4-(nitroxy)butyl(2S)-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propanoate], and naproxen on key pathogenic steps in NSAID-enteropathy in the rat. Methods: Single doses of AZD3582, naproxen (dose range $10-300 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) or vehicle were given to male Sprague Dawley rats. Intestinal permeability ( ${ }^{51} \mathrm{CrEDTA}$ ) and intestinal inflammation (granulocyte marker protein) was quantitated and ulcer counts made. Results: Intestinal permeability (all doses) and inflammation (highest dose of the drugs) increased significantly from control levels following naproxen and AZD3582 and there was no significant difference between the drugs. Median ulcer counts were, however, significantly ( $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ ) lower with AZD3582 (4 $\pm 2$ ) than with naproxen $(17 \pm 4)$. Conclusions: Naproxen and AZD3582 are equally associated with increased small intestinal permeability and inflammation, which is the consequence of their topical effect. The reduced small bowel ulcer counts with AZD3582 accords with the suggestion that vascular factors are the main driving force for NSAID-induced ulcer formation.

## Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause gastrointestinal side effects which involve the stomach as well as the small bowel mucosa (Hawkey and Langman, 2003). Although the serious gastric side effects of bleeding and perforation have attracted the most attention, it is increasingly clear that the small bowel is associated with similar types and prevalence of complications (Bjarnason et al., 1993; Laine et al., 2002)

The pathogenesis of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage is uncertain. There is substantial evidence to suggest that NSAID-enteropathy in rodents is caused by various combinations of the selective biochemical effects of NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibition together with the topical effect (Somasundaram et al., 1995). The topical effect is thought to relate to the physicochemical properties of NSAIDs to act as detergents (Lichtenberger et al., 1995) and uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Somasundaram et al., 1995). Collectively, it is suggested that the topical effect results in increased intestinal permeability with mucosal exposure of luminal aggressive factors and hence inflammation. It is also suggested that NSAID-induced inhibition of COX1, with decreased amounts of vasoactive prostaglandins, drives this inflammation to ulcers (Wallace et al., 2000). Interestingly small bowel damage occurs with long-term COX-2 absence or inhibition (small bowel inflammation and ulcers) although the mechanisms are unclear (Sigthorsson et al., 2002).

One of the more recent suggestions for reducing the intestinal side effects of NSAIDs is to attach a nitric oxide (NO) moiety to the NSAID, in the hope that the NO might counteract the effect of prostaglandin deficiency on the intestinal microcirculation. NO donors have been used in patients

Urinary excretion of ${ }^{51}$-CrEDTA



Fig. 1 Urinary excretion of ${ }^{51}$ CrEDTA after Naproxen and AZD3582. The white circles represent median (bars represent range) values obtained from rats dosed with naproxen. The black circles represent values obtained from rats dosed with AZD3582. Urinary excretion of ${ }^{51}$ CrEDTA was measured 5 hours following dosing.

## Results

## Intestinal Permeability

Figure 1 shows that administration of both naproxen and AZD3582 significantly increased intestinal permeability at all doses given when compared with baseline (vehicle only) ( $p<0.001$ ). There was no significant difference ( $p>0.05$ ) in intestinal permeability between AZD3582 and naproxen at any of the doses given.

## Intestinal Inflammation

There was no significant increase in GMP with the 10 or $30 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$ doses of either drug (Figure 2). Rats given AZD3582 at a dose of $100 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$ had GMP values significantly higher than the control group ( $p<0.05$ ). At doses of $300 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$, a significant increase in intestinal inflammation was noted with both naproxen and AZD3582 when compared to the vehicle group ( $p<0.01$ ). No significant difference was observed between the two drugs at any of the dose range tested.

## Macroscopic examination

On macroscopic examination, no ulcers were seen with either drug over a dose range of $0-100 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$. The mean number

of ulcers with naproxen $300 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) was 17.1 (range 1029). The rats treated with AZD3582 had significantly fewer ulcers ( $p<0.001$ ) (median 2.5 ; range $0-12$ ) (Figure 3).

## Discussion

These studies show that AZD3582 is associated with significantly less small bowel ulcerative damage than naproxen while the postulated consequences of the topical effect, intestinal permeability and inflammation, is equally evident with both drugs. The findings are consistent (assuming that the NO is released prior to or during drug absorption ren-
