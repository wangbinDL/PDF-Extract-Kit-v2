#### Abstract

Ehrlichia chaffeensis causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. These related tick-borne rickettsial organisms can cause severe and fatal illness. During 20002007, the reported incidence rate of E. chaffeensis increased from 0.80 to 3.0 cases/million persons/year. The case-fatality rate was $1.9 \%$, and the hospitalization rate was $49 \%$. During 2000-2007, the reported incidence of $A$. phagocytophilum increased from 1.4 to 3.0 cases/million persons/year. The case-fatality rate was $0.6 \%$, and the hospitalization rate was $36 \%$. Rates among female patients were lower than among male patients for ehrlichiosis (rate ratio $=0.68$ ) and anaplasmosis (rate ratio $=0.70$ ). Most ( $80 \%$ ) ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis cases met only a probable case definition, although, use of a polymerase chain reaction to confirm infections increased during 2000-2007. Heightened reporting of these diseases will likely continue with improving recognition, changing surveillance practices, and appropriate application of diagnostic assays.

## INTRODUCTION

Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are tick-borne illnesses caused by obligate intracellular bacteria of the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, respectively. Although suspected cases were previously reported, the first case of human monocytic ehrlichiosis was documented in a patient at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas in 1991, and the causative agent was named Ehrlichia chaffeensis. ${ }^{1-3}$ Human granulocytic infections by Anaplasma were first reported in patients from Wisconsin and Minnesota in 1994. ${ }^{4-6}$ Originally classified under the genus Ehrlichia, the causative agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was later determined to be the same agent as Ehrlichia phagocytophila and Ehrlichia equi. All three agents were reclassified under the species Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 2001. ${ }^{7}$ Ehrlichia ewingii was first identified as an agent of human disease from four residents of Missouri. ${ }^{8}$

Clinical presentations of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are similar and nonspecific. ${ }^{9}$ Symptoms frequently include fever, chills, headache, myalgia, and nausea. Up to $30 \%$ of patients and $60 \%$ of children infected with E. chaffeensis have a rash; a rash is less commonly reported in A. phagocytophilum patients. ${ }^{10,11}$ Laboratory findings associated with ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and elevated creatinine levels. ${ }^{9-11}$ Patients treated with tetracycline typically recover quickly, and surveillance reports have indicated that the overall case-fatality rate was low. ${ }^{12,13}$ Complications can be severe and include adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, central nervous system involvement, and renal failure. ${ }^{9,12}$

Human cases are associated with exposure to ticks. The Lone Star tick, Amblyomma americanum, maintains the enzootic cycle of E. chaffeensis primarily among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). ${ }^{14-16}$ The intersection of the vector and the reservoir of E. chaffeensis occurs largely in the southeastern and south-central United States. ${ }^{17,18}$ Ehrlichia ewingii may be maintained in a similar enzootic cycle, with deer and domestic dogs proposed as possible reservoir species. ${ }^{19-21}$ Small mammals are the primary reservoir for $A$. phagocytophilum, and the vectors Ixodes scapularis (black-legged or deer tick) and Ixodes pacificus (western black-legged tick) maintain A. phagocytophilum prevalence primarily in the northeastern, the upper midwestern, and the Pacific coast regions. ${ }^{16,17,22,23}$ Previous surveillance summaries found most cases reported within these areas. ${ }^{12,13}$

In 2000, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) published surveillance case definitions for infection by E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum. ${ }^{24}$ A third reportable category for Undetermined, Unspecified, or Other Agent (UUOA) captured cases where available laboratory evidence was insufficient to specify the causative agent and cases where the causative agent was specified as an agent other than E. chaffeensis or $A$. phagocytophilum. These three surveillance case definitions were used until January 2008, when the CSTE implemented new case definitions. ${ }^{25}$ We summarize ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis surveillance data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during 2000-2007.

## METHODS

National surveillance systems. Individual state and territory health departments report surveillance data to CDC through the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) and through manually completed Case Report Forms (CRFs). NETSS captures demographics such as county of residence, sex, race group, Hispanic ethnicity, and age. These data are used to calculate reported incidence rates across demographics and time. Cases are reported as either probable or confirmed by the State or Local Public Health Departments. Reports from California do not differentiate between probable and confirmed cases.

The CRFs capture additional data on clinical presentation, clinical course, laboratory data, and patient outcome. These data from CRFs are used to calculate descriptive statistics supplementing the NETSS data. The quality of the data from both systems varies by state and locality. Clinicians must make accurate diagnoses, request appropriate laboratory assays, and

EHRLICHIOSIS AND ANAPLASMOSIS IN THE UNITED STATES, 2000-2007 report sufficient information before a case may be classified according to the CSTE definitions.

The data presented in this report differ from the data presented in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) annual summaries; the MMWR lists cases by report date whereas this analysis uses date of onset when available. Also, the reportable category UUOA was not published in the MMWR during 2000-2004. However, these reported cases are included in this analysis.

Analytical and statistical methods. Confirmed and probable cases reported through NETSS with an event date during 2000-2007 were used as the numerator for calculating reported incidence rates. Reported incidence was calculated as a rate per million persons per year (PY) by using population estimates from the United States Census Bureau for each county and for both sexes. ${ }^{26,27}$ Because of the large proportion of cases with missing race and ethnicity information in the NETSS data, comparisons of rates between races and ethnic groups were omitted. Cases reported through the CRFs were included in this analysis if the onset date was during 2000-2007 and the cases met confirmed or probable case definition. All analyses were performed using SAS ${ }^{\circledR}$ software. ${ }^{28}$ Because these results were calculated from all reported cases, the sampling fraction was one, and statistical tests of significance and confidence intervals were not included.

Reporting states. States that did not consider the disease reportable for a given year were excluded from that year's analysis. During 2000-2007, E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum were not reportable through NETSS for Alaska (20002001, 2005-2007), Colorado (2000-2003, 2005, 2007), Washington, DC (2000, 2003-2005, 2007), Hawaii (2000, 2006-2007), Iowa (2005-2007), Idaho (2000-2001, 2005-2007), Illinois (2000), Louisiana (2000-2001, 2003-2005), Maryland (2000-2001), Mississippi (2001, 2007), Montana (2000-2001, 2006-2007), North Dakota (2000-2005, 2007), New Mexico (2000-2001, 2007), Nevada (2000, 2005, 2007), Oregon (2000), Pennsylvania (2003-2004), Vermont (2000), and Washington (2006-2007).

During 2000, the UUOA category was reportable through NETSS only in New York. During 2001-2007, this category was not reportable for Alaska (2001, 2005-2007), Colorado (20012003, 2005, 2007), Washington, DC (2003-2006, 2007), Hawaii (2006-2007), Iowa (2005-2007), Idaho (2001, 2005-2007), Louisiana (2003-2005), Maryland (2001), Mississippi (2001, 2007), Montana (2001, 2006-2007), North Dakota (2001-2005, 2007), Nebraska (2007), New Jersey (2005-2006), New Mexico (2001, 2007), Nevada (2005, 2007), Pennsylvania (2003-2004), and Washington (2006-2007).

## RESULTS

Ehrlichia chaffeensis. During 2000-2007, a total of 3,126 cases of E. chaffeensis were reported through NETSS (Table 1). The national reported incidence rate was 1.4 cases per million PY. Reported incidence rates by state (Table 2) and county (Figure 1A) indicate endemic disease in southeastern and south-central United States, especially in Central and Atlantic census regions. Reported incidence increased during the study period from 0.80 cases per million PY during 2000 to 3.0 cases per million PY during 2007 (Figure 2).

Reported rates among female patients (rate ratio [RR] $=0.68$ ) were lower than among male patients. Reported incidence rates increased with age (Figure 3), and rates among persons 60-69 years of age ( $R R=2.4$ ) were the highest compared with the entire population. Reported cases were primarily among persons of white race and non-Hispanic ethnicity (Table 1). Of the 2,365 reported cases with a date for onset of symptoms (Figure 4), reporting peaked in the summer months from June through August $(\mathrm{n}=1,458,62 \%)$, and the fewest cases were reported during the winter months of December, January, or February ( $n=75,3.2 \%$ ).

During the same study period 1,206 cases of E. chaffeensis were reported to CDC via CRFs (Table 1), of which 240 (20\%) were classified as confirmed cases. Among cases reporting hospitalization status (Table 3), $570(49 \%)$ were

A higher proportion was hospitalized among persons $60-69$ years of age ( $54 \%$ ) and persons $\geq 70$ years of age ( $71 \%$ ) than among other age groups (Figure 5). Of the cases reporting clinical outcome (Table 3), there were 19 fatal cases ( $1.9 \%$ ). Case-fatality rates were higher among persons $5-9$ years of age (3.7\%), 60-69 years of age ( $2.5 \%$ ) and $\geq 70$ years of age ( $3.5 \%$ ) than among other age groups. The median time between onset and death was 11 days (

*Percentages are based on the proportion of patients reported with any life-threatening illness. Overall reports of life-threatening illness were low, and details regarding how a specific diagnosis (such as DIC or ARDS) was made were not acquired. Data include confirmed and probable cases.
$\dagger$ ARDS $=$ adult respiratory distress syndrome.
DIC = disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
Of the cases reporting immune status $(n=1,943), 79(6.5 \%)$ reported immunosuppressive conditions, including 15 cases $(0.77 \%)$ with cancer, 9 cases with diabetes $(0.5 \%), 5$ cases $(0.2 \%)$ with arthritis, and 4 cases ( $0.2 \%$ ) with asplenia. The median age among those reporting an immunosuppressive condition was 65.5 years, and the median age among immunocompetent persons was 54 years. The clinical course was worse for immunosuppressed cases relative to immunocompetent cases when the outcomes hospitalization ( $\mathrm{RR}=1.9$ ), a life-threatening complication $(\mathrm{RR}=2.8)$, and death $(\mathrm{RR}=3.9)$ were used.

A total of 1,080 cases $(53 \%)$ relied on a single positive serologic test result for supporting laboratory evidence. Most A. phagocytophilum cases were reported with only IFA IgG $(n=1,068,52 \%)$ as supporting laboratory evidence. However, only a small number of these serologic diagnoses ( $n=89$, $8.3 \%$ ) demonstrated seroconversion on IFA and were classified as confirmed cases. A small proportion of $A$. phagocytophilum cases $(n=334,16 \%)$ were confirmed by means of PCR. However, the proportion of PCR-positive cases increased in 2006 and 2007 (Figure 6B).

Undetermined, unspecified, or other agent. During 20002007 a total of 824 cases of UUOA were reported through the NETSS (Table 1). Although this category included possible reports of E. ewingii during the study period, this category was most frequently used by states to report cases for which the causative agent could not be definitively identified or for which a conclusive assay was not available. The national reported incidence of UUOA cases was 0.42 cases per million PY. Reported incidence rates of UUOA were highest in states where A. phagocytophilum was endemic during the same time period (Table 2, Figure 1C). Reporting under this category increased from 0.21 cases per million PY during 2000 up to 1.2 cases per million PY during 2007 (Figure 2). Reported incidence rates for the UUOA category increased with age similar to those for ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis (Figure 3). Reported rates among female patients $(R R=0.71)$ were lower than among male patients. Cases were predominantly reported for the white race group and non-Hispanic ethnicity (Table 1). Of the 723 cases with reported onset dates (Figure 4), 456 cases $(63 \%)$ became symptomatic during the summer months from June through August.

A total of 656 cases of UUOA were reported to CDC via CRFs (Table 1), including 113 (17\%) that met a confirmed case definition. Among these cases of UUOA, nine cases (1\%) of E. ewingii were reported from Missouri ( $n=8$ ) and Minnesota $(n=1)$. The single E. ewingii case reported from Minnesota was later determined to be a species of Ehrlichia distinct from E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis (McFadden JW and others, International Conference of Emerging Infectious Diseases, 2010). Among UUOA cases reporting hospitalization status (Table 3), 225 cases (35\%) were hospitalized. The proportion hospitalized was highest among persons $<5$ year of age ( $64 \%$ ) and $\geq 70$ years of age (53\%) (Figure 5). Of the

The annual number of cases are subdivided into polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases, PCR-negative cases, and cases in which PCR was not performed. The annotation above each vertical bar is the annual percent of reported cases diagnosed by using PCR. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting CRFs in 2000, few cases were reported in 2000.
