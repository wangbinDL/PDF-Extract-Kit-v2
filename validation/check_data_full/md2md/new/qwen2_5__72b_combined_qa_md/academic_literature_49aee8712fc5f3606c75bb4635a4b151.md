#### Abstract

Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations are monitored using 2 general approaches—population indices and abundance estimators. Due to their convenient sampling designs, indices are commonly used by land managers and researchers to predict or estimate hunting-season populations. We evaluated the efficacy of 4 bobwhite indices (spring cock [adult male] call-counts, autumn covey callcounts, roadside surveys, and helicopter surveys) to predict hunting-season population size by relating them to abundance estimators (minimum known population [no. unique trapped individuals each year], markrecapture, helicopter-based distance sampling). Data were collected at the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch in Fisher County, Texas, USA, during 2009-2018. Spring cock call-counts and autumn covey callcounts were analyzed at 2 spatial scales: ranch scale ( 1,781 ha) and point scale (i.e., within the presumed radius of audibility of listening points; 600 m or 113 ha). Roadside and helicopter surveys were conducted at the ranch scale along 31 - and $90-\mathrm{km}$ transects, respectively. At the ranch scale, mean spring cock call-counts were a modest predictor of minimum known populations ( $r^{2}=0.54$ ) and good predictor of mark-recapture estimates $\left(r^{2}=0.80\right)$. At the point scale, the mean number of cocks heard was a poor predictor of densities surrounding points $\left(r^{2}=0.0003\right)$ as estimated by distance sampling. The mean number of coveys heard during autumn counts was a significant predictor of both minimum known populations ( $\left.r^{2}=0.88\right)$ and mark-recapture estimates ( $r^{2}=0.85$ ) at the ranch scale but was a weak predictor of densities immediately surrounding listening points ( $r^{2}=0.22$ ). Helicopter surveys during November (individuals/km) were a significant predictor of minimum known populations $\left(r^{2}=0.98\right)$ and mark-recapture $\left(r^{2}=0.93\right)$. Overall, roadside surveys (individuals/km) conducted during September was the best index for predicting minimum known populations ( $r^{2}=0.99$ ) and mark-recapture estimates $\left(r^{2}=0.97\right)$. Our results suggest the linear relationship between indices and autumn-winter populations for bobwhite are stronger when conducted closer in time to hunting season and at larger scales. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.

Approximately $95 \%$ of land in Texas, USA, is privately owned, leaving management of wildlife primarily within the private sector (Texas Land Conservancy [TLC] 2015). In practice, wildlife management involves 3 main processes: 1) habitat or population manipulation; 2) monitoring, or surveying, variables of interest; and 3) evaluating response of variables to manipulation. For northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite), indices and abundance

[^0]estimators are 2 general approaches used for monitoring populations, yielding measures of 'relative' and 'absolute' abundance, respectively (Hernández and Guthery 2012:136). Despite being recommended only for monitoring general population trends, wildlife managers often use indices to estimate abundance and inform management decisions (e.g., harvest restrictions) because of their convenient (i.e., simple or cost-effective) sampling designs (Anderson 2001; Hansen and Guthery 2001; Engeman 2003, 2005; Riddle et al. 2008).

Indexing bobwhite populations via auditory and visual observation counts has been used since the 1920s (Nice and Nice 1921, Stoddard 1931). Three common indices used to monitor bobwhite populations include spring cock [adult male] call-counts, autumn covey call-counts, and roadside

surveys. Wildlife managers typically use these indices to forecast hunting populations, set expectations, and define site-specific harvest quotas (Brennan et al. 2014). These expectations operate on multiple scales, depending on how the indices are conducted and reported. For example, during years when more bobwhite are heard or seen during the spring and autumn, it is assumed that overall regional abundance (i.e., ranch scale) will be linearly related to these observations during hunting-season. At a smaller scale (i.e., point scale), hunters expect to have greater success at specific locations where more quail were heard or seen because indices are assumed to be proportional to abundance.

Spring cock call-counts consist of an observer counting the number of singing males from a given location during peak calling months (e.g., May-Jul). However, reliability of the technique for quantifying abundance and predicting hunting populations has been questioned, with equivocal results (Robel et al. 1969, Schwartz 1974, Terhune et al. 2006, Reyna et al. 2012).

Similar to the spring cock call index, autumn covey callcounts are point counts in which observers count the number of coveys heard during October. The reliability of autumn covey call-counts as a gauge of bobwhite abundance has also yielded mixed results. DeMaso et al. (1992) and Rusk et al. (2007) suggested covey counts correlated poorly with autumn densities in South Texas and should only be used as crude measures of abundance. Conversely, autumn covey call-counts have been reported to provide reliable estimates of abundance when conducted using grid sampling (as opposed to point counts; Wellendorf and Palmer 2005). However, counts conducted under these circumstances are arguably impractical for landowners because of the observer effort required (i.e., 4 observers/25-ha grid). Covey counts may also yield reliable estimates when incorporating detection probability and accounting for factors that influence it such as calling rates, observers, and environmental conditions (Wellendorf et al. 2004, Wellendorf and Palmer 2005). At this juncture, however, these counts cease to be considered an index and more represent an abundance estimator. Moreover, ancillary data or assumptions of covey size are still required to obtain an abundance estimate when conducted under these circumstances.

Roadside surveys are a visual index in which observers record the number of bobwhites observed while driving a predefined route. August roadside surveys serve as Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's (TPWD) index for relative abundance of quail (bobwhite and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) at an ecoregion scale and are strongly correlated with statewide harvest in Texas (DeMaso et al. 2002). However, there is scant information on roadside surveys as they relate to populations at smaller scales.
Helicopter surveys are used as both indices and abundance estimators for bobwhite (Shupe et al. 1987, Rusk et al. 2007, Schnupp et al. 2013). Many managers conducting helicopter surveys do not collect distance data. Therefore, these surveys may only perform as an index (i.e., individuals/ km ). Helicopter surveys can be financially demanding (Table S1, available online in Supporting Information) and pilots often do not want to commit large amounts of time flying small areas ( $<2,000$ ha; DeMaso et al. 2010); therefore, aerial surveys can be limited in their constituency and practicality.

Methods for obtaining 'absolute' abundance estimates for bobwhite include mark-recapture (Petersen 1896, Lincoln 1930) and distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2015) using walking transects (Guthery 1988, Rusk et al. 2007) or helicopter transects (Rusk et al. 2009, DeMaso et al. 2010, Schnupp et al. 2013). Intensive mark-recapture methods are considered, by some, as the standard for estimating abundance (Pierce et al. 2012). If data are not sufficient for reliable abundance estimates, mark-recapture trapping at the least, provides an unequivocal minimum estimate of abundance (i.e., minimum known population). However, trapping wildlife requires special permits and obtaining sufficient captures and recaptures for reliable estimates involve considerable time and effort. Thus, these methods typically are not practical for most managers.
Distance sampling generates estimates of abundance as a function of number of individuals or clusters (e.g., coveys) encountered along a series of transects or points, cluster (covey) size, effective survey width, and area sampled. Helicopter surveys using electronic systems (e.g., rangefinders, personal digital assistants) to collect distance data are generally accepted as a more efficient survey method for estimating quail abundance relative to walked line-transects (Shupe et al. 1987, Rusk et al. 2007, Schnupp et al. 2013).

Indices are used ubiquitously for bobwhite; therefore, identifying reliable yet practical indices to monitor bobwhite populations is important for managers and researchers. If correlated, the potential exists to make inferences about abundance from indices using traditional regression analyses, standard ratio, or correction factors (Anderson 2003, Engeman 2003; see DeMaso et al. 2010). Surprisingly, however, there have been few attempts to relate indices to estimates of 'absolute' abundance or density estimates. Rather, most studies have compared 2 measures of relative abundance, which is a poor validation technique of an index because the actual population parameter remains largely unknown (Anderson 2003).

Our objective was to assess the relationship between 4 bobwhite indices (e.g., spring cock call-counts, autumn covey counts, roadside surveys, and helicopter surveys) and estimates of abundance (e.g., mark-recapture, minimum known population, distance-based helicopter surveys) at 2 spatial scales in the Rolling Plains of Texas. We hypothesized the strength of indices to predict hunting populations would depend on the scale at which surveys were conducted, and predicted that indices across large scales would be more reliable than small scales because of variability in processes that affect abundance at smaller scales.

## STUDY AREA

This study was conducted on the Rolling Plains Quail Research Ranch (RPQRR) in Fisher County, Texas, during 2009-2018 (Fig. 1). The RPQRR was a 1,911-ha area that served as a research and demonstration facility for quail

management practices in the Rolling Plains of Texas. The RPQRR was a mixed-grass prairie characterized by woody vegetation such as honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), catclaw acacia (Senegalia greggii), lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia), wolfberry (Lycium berlandieri), agarito (Berberis trifoliata), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata; U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2015a). Common grasses included silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), plains bristlegrass (Setaria vulpiseta), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides; U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 20152015a). Approximately 211 ha of RPQRR were enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program in 1986; these fields were dominated by kleingrass (Panicum coloratum). The RPQRR was deferred from grazing from June 2011 to the end of the study, but prescribed fire was an integral part for management of the ranch.

The majority of RPQRR was Miles fine sandy loam, Woodward-Quinlan loam, Wichita clay loam, and Paducah loam soil series (U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 20152015b). Slopes ranged from $3 \%$ to $5 \%$ across most of the ranch and up to $25 \%$ on rocky outcrops. Average annual precipitation for RPQRR during 2009-2018 was 53.9 cm and ranged from 21 cm to 84 cm . Long-term (30-year), average annual precipitation for the area is 55.5 cm (PRISM Climate Group 2019). Scaled quail occur sympatrically with bobwhite on RPQRR, but have never comprised $>7 \%$ of the collective minimum known population in a given year.

## METHODS

## Data Collection

Indices.—We placed 25 listening points spaced approximately 1.5 km apart along pre-established routes (i.e., 2-track lanes with low intensity of use) at RPQRR. Listening points were numbered $0-12$ and $0-11$ along designated west and east routes (see roadside surveys), respectively. We conducted spring cock call-counts twice weekly at each listening point during 15 May-15 June 2009-2017. Each listening point therefore was subjected to 8 counts annually. We assumed a $600-\mathrm{m}$ radius of audibility ( 113 ha ) to adhere with the Texas Quail Index, a citizen science protocol that advocates for the use of the spring cock call index for monitoring bobwhite populations (Reyna et al. 2012). The radius of audibility is the distance that an observer can detect a call or song, and for spring cock call-counts, has been suggested to range from 400 m to 800 m (Stoddard 1931, Hansen and Guthery 2001, Cram et al. 2002, Rollins et al. 2005).
Counts were conducted by 3-5 members of ranch personnel, with each member randomly allocated points. Counts were conducted in accordance to the Texas Quail

Index, which dictated that observers record the number of cocks heard singing during a 5-minute interval on a data sheet that denotes the approximate location of singing males in relation to the observer. The Texas Quail Index protocol required observers to begin spring cock call-counts at, or just prior to, official sunrise. Counts did not exceed a duration of 1.5 hours postsunrise to assure capturing the interval of daily peak singing activity (Hansen and Guthery 2001). To account for changes in singing activity due to daily phenology, observers alternated their starting listening points for their respective routes. Additionally, observers rotated routes among members every 2 weeks to address possible biases among observers. Observers did not conduct spring cock call-counts when weather conditions were assumed to alter detection (e.g., wind $>16 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ [kph], rain). Before observers were allowed to collect data independently, they were accompanied and trained by an experienced observer on procedures. Trainees were not allowed to conduct counts independently until a general consensus on number of singing males was met by the trainer and trainee(s) during trial runs. The mean number of cocks heard singing at each listening point and across the ranch for each year served as the index for each spatial scale (i.e., listening point and ranch scale).

We conducted autumn covey call-counts during October 2009-2017 at 12 (i.e., the odd-numbered points) of the 25 listening points used for spring cock call-counts. We subsampled listening points for autumn covey call-counts because of the length of time required to complete each survey. We sampled the same 12 points each year and trained observers before allowing them to collect data independently. Training trials continued until trainer and trainees achieved similar estimates for the number of coveys heard. Observers arrived at a listening point approximately 45 minutes before official sunrise and counted the number of coveys heard calling in relation to the observer. Radius of audibility for covey calls, again, was assumed to be 600 m , although radii of 400 m to 900 m have been reported (Roseberry 1982, Rusk et al. 2009). Observers continued counts for 20 minutes after the first call was recorded or until sunrise (DeMaso et al. 1992). Observers replicated covey counts twice for each listening point within a 1-week period, but not on consecutive days or by the same observer. Observers did not conduct counts if it was raining or winds exceeded 16 kph . The mean number of coveys heard calling for each listening point and across the ranch for each year served as the index for each spatial scale (i.e., listening point and ranch scale). We used mean counts, as opposed to peaks in call-counts, to continue adherence with Texas Quail Index protocol.

We repeated roadside surveys 4 times each year during 1-15 September 2009-2017. Roadside surveys followed a 31-km transect along the same secondary roads that connected the 25 listening points. We conducted surveys at approximately 24 kph within 2 hours postsunrise and 2 hours presunset; survey teams consisted of 3 observers and a driver who also acted as an observer (Rollins et al. 2005). We divided the survey transect into 2 routes (east and west) to assure surveys were completed within the 2-hour timeframe. Half of the route was completed during morning hours and the remainder during the evening. We alternated morning and evening surveys between east and west routes. We used an all-terrain vehicle (Lannom Industries, Fort Stockton, TX, USA) to conduct roadside surveys; observers counted all quails observed while driving along the route. We could not reliably distinguish scaled quail from bobwhites during roadside surveys, and thus we pooled counts. We did not detect scaled quail every year of the study, and they never comprised $>7 \%$ of the collective minimum known population of quails in a given year. The mean number of individuals observed/km served as the roadside index for each year at the ranch scale.
We conducted helicopter surveys in November 2009-2017 following the general procedure of DeMaso et al. (2010) as developed by Rusk et al. (2007) and Schnupp et al. (2013). We created 19 transects, spaced 200 m apart, in ArcMap (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and loaded them on a Garmin Nuvi Global Positioning System for aerial navigation. Total survey effort per year was approximately 90 km . We flew surveys in an R44 Raven II helicopter (Robinson Helicopter Company, Torrance, CA, USA) at approximately 39 kph and altitudes of $7-11 \mathrm{~m}$ above ground. The helicopter seated 3 observers and a pilot, who also acted as an observer. We did not fly when wind speed was $>24 \mathrm{kph}$, fog was present, it was raining, or at temperatures $>30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. To avoid recounting individuals, we did not fly transects sequentially, but alternated them (i.e., every third transect was flown in a series). We flew all transects on the same day, within a 4-hour timeframe. We used the same pilot and helicopter for the duration of this study. We used the Modified System for Electronic Surveys for recording data (Schnupp et al. 2013). Following an encounter, we instructed the pilot to hover the helicopter momentarily as observers recorded the number of quail and location of the sighting. We did not obtain detection distances during November surveys. Thus, we evaluated helicopter surveys during November as an index (individuals/km) and utilized January surveys as abundance estimators.

Abundance estimators.-We obtained 3 estimates of abundance: minimum known population, mark-recapture estimates, and January density as determined by aerialbased distance sampling. We define minimum known population as the total number of unique bobwhites caught within a trapping season at the ranch scale. We recognize minimum known populations are not, by definition, abundance estimators because they do not incorporate detection but instead serve as an unequivocal estimate of minimum population abundance. We defined mark-recapture estimates as abundance estimates derived from individual capture histories during trapping, at the ranch scale. We defined January density as density estimates within a 600-m radius of listening points derived from density surface models generated from helicopter-based distance sampling.

We conducted mark-recapture trapping during late November and early December 2009-2017 using walk-in funnel traps (Stoddard 1931). We placed each trap site




---

$\left(n=29_{6}\right)$ along ranch roads and prebaited with milo $2-4$ weeks prior to trapping to increase trap success. To minimize predation, we concealed each trap with dried vegetation (e.g., Yucca glauca). Baiting did not occur until after roadside surveys were completed. We distributed traps at an average of 1 trap/6 ha, or $\geq 1$ trap/average home-range size for bobwhite in the Rolling Plains (Buckley et al. 2015). Given the logistics of handling the capture yield of 296 traps, we divided the ranch and trapped in quadrants ( $\sim 450 \mathrm{ha}$ ). Within quadrants, we set each trap for 5-7 occasions. If birds were caught in $>1$ quadrant, we removed the record for the individual from all but the initial quadrant to avoid overestimation in the analysis. We set traps either in the morning (0530) and checked 3 hours postsunrise, or set traps in the evening (1430) and checked at dusk.

We assumed demographic closure when each quadrant was trapped within 7 days. In 2009 and 2010, we did not meet our criterion for the assumption of demographic closure because trapping duration exceeded our time constraint. Thus, we generated mark-recapture estimates for 2011-2017. We assumed geographic closure, complete sampling coverage, and an effective survey area of 1,781 ha based on the RPQRR boundary. Though complete geographic closure is difficult to assure in any instance, certain barriers specific to the study site (i.e., physical structures increasing reluctance to disperse; Fig. 1) likely aided in meeting the assumption of geographic closure during quadrant trapping intervals (5-7 days).

Bobwhites were processed by multiple observers to minimize the time individuals remained in traps. We sequestered individuals in zippered pillow cases and processed in the bird-banding lab at RPQRR immediately after morning trapping or during the morning following evening trapping. We banded quail using size $7(5.6 \mathrm{~mm})$ aluminum leg bands (National Band and Tag Co., Newport, KY, USA) with unique band numbers. We released all quail within 18 hours of capture at the trap site where they were caught. Handling of all live specimens was conducted in accordance with Texas A\&M University-Kingsville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (2015-11-12).

In addition to November helicopter surveys, we conducted helicopter surveys in early January 2016-2018 following a conventional distance-sampling approach (Buckland et al. 2015). We utilized the same type of helicopter (Raven R 44) as for our November surveys and followed similar flight protocol in regards to flight conditions, average air speed, and altitude. We based our distance sampling methodology and equipment setup for this platform on Rusk et al. (2007) and Schnupp et al. (2013). We spaced January helicopter transects 365 m apart to reduce flight time because other areas were also being surveyed during these days.

## Statiscal Analysis

Abundance estimators.-Mark-recapture abundance estimates were generated in Program MARK using the Huggins' random-effects data platform. We wanted to account for potential behavioral, temporal, and intrinsic factors. Therefore, we constructed 12 a priori models in Program MARK based on Otis et al. (1978) models and random effects, as well as 4 additive models including effects of age, sex, and their interaction on the null model. We used model-averaging to derive an abundance estimate for each quadrant, and summed quadrant estimates to obtain an annual abundance estimate for the ranch. We removed models that did not converge before model-averaging. We calculated variance for abundance using the delta method.

The data set for our January helicopter surveys included only 3 years of data and therefore was not suitable for our ranch-scale analysis. However, these data allowed us to develop density surface models and map density across the landscape, which further allowed us to determine the relevance of our call-count indices at the point scale (Miller et al. 2013).

To map quail density across RPQRR, we followed a 3stage approach utilizing our distance sampling data. First, we fit a detection function model to our line-transect data based on prescribed methods in Buckland et al. (2015) within the 'distance' package (Ver. 0.9.7; Miller 2014) in R (Ver. 3.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Second, we modeled bobwhite density using environmental covariates and our previously determined detection function with a generalized additive model according to methods outlined in Miller et al. (2013). We divided transects into $100-\mathrm{m}$ segments, which generally corresponded to twice the truncation distance of detection function models, as prescribed in Miller et al. (2013). We determined environmental covariates, geographic location, and covey detection information for each segment to create the data set for our model. Environmental covariates consisted of the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index, which provided a continuous index of total vegetation cover, and the percent of landscape and mean patch area of woody cover.

We modeled estimated bobwhite density per segment in Program R utilizing the 'dsm' package (Ver. 2.2.15; Miller et al. 2017). We modeled density with a Tweedie response distribution, which accounted for the inflated zeros in the data set. The model consisted of all environmental covariates and geographic location of each segment.

Lastly, we used the digital surface model to predict bobwhite density across the RPQRR based on a prediction grid for each of the covariates used in the model. The predicted digital surface model had a resolution of 1 ha. To represent the radius of audibility, we generated $600-\mathrm{m}$ circular buffers around listening points and calculated density within the buffers (i.e., mean of density surface model values) using the zonal statistics spatial analyst tool in ArcMap 10.3 (Environmental System Research Institute [ESRI], Redlands, CA, USA).

Relationship between indices and abundance.-We used simple linear regression (PROC REG, SAS 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to evaluate the linear relationships between indices and abundance estimators. Each index was regressed to minimum known populations and mark-recapture estimates at the ranch scale.




---

Additionally, we regressed spring cock call-counts and autumn covey call-counts against density estimates based on digital surface models, at the point scale. Results for descriptive statistics are presented as the mean $\pm$ standard error.

Bobwhite and scaled quail could not always be distinguished during helicopter surveys or roadside surveys; we pooled minimum known populations and mark-recapture estimates across species for analyses of helicopter surveys and roadside surveys. Species could be distinguished during audible surveys, so spring cock call-counts and autumn covey call-counts for bobwhites were related only to bobwhite minimum known populations and mark-recapture estimates.
Bobwhite populations in the Rolling Plains exhibit irruptive population cycles (Lusk et al. 2007). We documented exceptionally low- and high-abundance populations during the study (Table 1); therefore, we evaluated the effects of individual observations on regression coefficients using the INFLUENCE option in SAS. We considered studentized residuals (RSTUDENT) with an absolute value $>2$ and $\mathrm{DFBETA}_{j(i)}$ values greater than $\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}$ as highly influential on regression coefficients (Belsey et al. 1980). Influence statistics describe individual residual variation and how the coefficient of determination would change in the absence of $i^{\text {th }}$ observation.

## RESULTS

## Indices

The mean number of cocks heard at the ranch scale during 2009-2017 ranged from $2.07 \pm 0.36$ to $7.49 \pm 0.42$ and was a modest predictor of the minimum known population $\left(F_{1,7}=8.37, P=0.02, r^{2}=0.54\right.$; Table 1; Fig. 2A). However, the observation from 2016 was highly influential on the regression slope (RSTUDENT $>2$; DFBETA $>0.67$ ). Similarly, the mean number of cocks heard was a reasonable predictor of autumn abundance estimated using mark-recapture $\left(F_{1,5}=19.4, P=0.007\right.$, $r^{2}=0.80$; Fig. 2B), but data points from 2016 and 2017 were highly influential observations on the regression slope (RSTUDENT $>2 ;$ DFBETA $>0.76$ ). At the point scale, the mean number of cocks heard per listening point ranged from $0.45 \pm 0.18$ to $8.83 \pm 1.04$. There was not a year $\times$ count interaction $\left(F_{1,2}=0.35, P=0.71\right)$, so we pooled across years. The mean number of cocks heard per listening point was a poor predictor $\left(F_{1,73}=0.02\right.$, $P=0.88, r^{2}=0.0003$ ) of January densities (listening-point scale; Fig. 2C).
At the ranch scale, the mean number of coveys heard during 2009-2017 ranged from $3.82 \pm 0.57$ to $13.00 \pm 0.52$ (Table 1). The mean number of coveys heard was a significant predictor of both minimum known population $\left(F_{1,7}=49.9, P \leq 0.001, r^{2}=0.88\right)$ and autumn abundance estimated using mark-recapture $\left(F_{1,5}=28.3, P=0.003\right.$, $r^{2}=0.85$; Fig. 3A, B). However, the observation from 2016 was highly influential on regression slopes for both MKP (RSTUDENT $>2$; DFBETA $>0.67$ ) and mark-recapture (RSTUDENT $>2$; DFBETA $>0.76$ ). At the point scale, the mean number of coveys heard per listening point ranged from $1.0 \pm 1.0$ to $17.0 \pm 1.0$. There was not a year $\times$ count interaction $\left(F_{1,2}=0.08, P=0.92\right)$, so we pooled counts across years. The mean number of coveys heard per listening point was a weak predictor of January densities (listening point scale) estimated using distance sampling $\left(F_{1,34}=9.61\right.$, $P=0.004, r^{2}=0.22$; Fig. 3C).

Our data consisted of years of extremely low and high bobwhite abundance, with few 'average' years (Table 1). Consequently, 2 data points strongly influenced call-count regression slopes as indicated by studentized residuals and DFBETA values. For example, evaluating scatterplots for the spring index at the ranch scale demonstrates little response in autumn abundance when the mean number of cocks heard increased from 2 to 5 (Fig. 2A, B). However, the coefficient of determination alone does not reflect this artifact.

The mean number of individuals observed $/ \mathrm{km}$ for roadside surveys ranged from $0.06 \pm 0.06$ to $16.52 \pm 2.3$ (Table 1). Roadside surveys served as a significant predictor of both minimum known populations $\left(F_{1,7}=998.7, P \leq 0.001\right.$, $r^{2}=0.99$ ) and mark-recapture estimates ( $\left.F_{1,5}=157.0, P<\right.$ $\left.0.001, r^{2}=0.97\right|$ Fig. 4A, C).

The number of individuals observed/km during helicopter surveys ranged from 0.26 to 22.41 (Table 1). The number of individuals observed/km during November helicopter surveys was a significant predictor of minimum known populations $\left(F_{1,7}=321.7, P \leq 0.001, r^{2}=0.98\right)$ and markrecapture estimates $\left(F_{1,5}=66.4, \quad P \leq 0.001, \quad r^{2}=0.93\right.$; Fig. 4B, D). The strongest predictor of minimum known populations and mark-recapture estimates was roadside surveys, followed by helicopter surveys, autumn covey counts, and spring cock counts (Table 2).

## Abundance Estimators

We trapped and banded 11,410 bobwhites during 20092017 with minimum known populations ranging from 77 to 4,393 bobwhites (Table 1). Mean capture probabilities varied from 0.17 (range $=0.08-0.30$ ) to 0.47 (range $=0.19-$ 0.91 ). Autumn abundance estimated using mark-recapture for bobwhites ranged from $143 \pm 105.0$ to $6,445 \pm 187.5$ (Table 1).
Density surface models were developed from January 2016, 2017, and 2018 helicopter surveys. Mean densities at the ranch scale ranged from $1.65 \pm 0.03$ birds/ha in 2018 to $3.65 \pm 0.08$ in 2017. Mean densities surrounding listening points (i.e., within our assumed radius of audibility) ranged from $0.23 \pm 0.04$ birds/ha in 2016 to $10.7 \pm 0.78$ birds/ha in 2017 (Fig. 5).

## DISCUSSION

Overall, we documented that indices were better predictors of bobwhite abundance at the ranch scale than at the point scale, supporting our hypothesis that indices are more reliable predictors of abundance at larger scales. In addition, the strength of this relationship increased from spring cock call-counts to covey call-counts to roadside surveys (i.e., from 'long-range' forecasts to 'short-range' forecasts). In other words, the linear relationship between indices and abundance estimates was stronger when conducted closer in time to hunting season and at a larger scale.

We observed that spring cock call-counts were modest predictors of minimum known populations and good predictors of mark-recapture estimates at the ranch scale, but were poor and insignificant predictors of density at the point scale. At the ranch scale, our results are similar to results of Parent et al. (2012), who demonstrated a relatively strong

correlation $(r=0.68)$ between spring cock counts and helicopter indices (coveys/km) at the pasture scale (2,000 ha). Terhune et al. (2006) related the peak number of cocks heard during spring to the number of covey calls within a 25 -ha quadrant during autumn. Using multiple linear regression, they found a strong relationship $\left(r^{2}=0.99\right)$ between peak calls and autumn abundance. However, the strength of this relationship may be the result of a large number of predictor variables used in their model $(K=8)$. We found a strong linear relationship between mean and peak cock call-counts at both the ranch $\left(r^{2}=0.94\right)$ and point scales $\left(r^{2}=0.82\right)$. Consequently, identifying peaks on our study site added little to predicting hunting-season abundance on our study site.

Reyna et al. (2012) and Sisson and Terhune (2017) compared spring cock call-counts to autumn covey callcounts (2 measures of relative abundance), assuming autumn counts were directly proportional to abundance. Reyna et al. (2012) found a weak relationship $\left(r^{2}=0.41\right.$, $n=64$ ) among their Texas study sites, whereas Sisson and Terhune (2017) demonstrated a much stronger relationship $\left(r^{2}=0.79, n=198\right)$ between the 2 indices in northern Florida and southern Georgia, USA. Sisson and Terhune (2017) related peak spring and autumn counts, whereas Reyna et al. (2012) compared means. Slight differences in methodology, and perhaps scale, could explain these discrepancies. Moreover, variability in quail reproduction and survival are largely sensitive to summer temperature and precipitation on western ranges (Hernández et al. 2005, Tri et al. 2013). Multiple cocks heard during spring or summer surveys may be a misleading indicator of subsequent autumn abundance if extreme temperatures and lack of rainfall curtail reproductive efforts and survival.

We observed that covey call-counts were a good predictor of both minimum known populations and mark-recapture estimates. This is in contrast to DeMaso et al. (1992) and Rusk et al. (2007), who reported weak or insignificant relationships between the 2 methods in their South Texas study sites. The difference in results is likely due to the fact that our regressions were greatly influenced by observations during 2016. At the point scale, our results tended to mirror that of DeMaso et al. (1992) and Rusk et al. (2007) in that autumn covey counts were a significant, but weak predictor $\left(r^{2}=0.22\right)$ of density on our study area.

We analyzed data from spring cock call-counts and autumn covey call-counts uncorrected for factors influencing detection probability; thus, there was variation in those data due to observer and environmental conditions. However, we felt it was justified to relate uncorrected counts to abundance estimates because uncorrected counts are most often

used by, and practical for, landowners and stakeholders. If a true relationship exists between call-counts and abundance, accounting for detection probabilities in indices may have refined the ability of our indices to predict hunting-season abundance.
We avoided forcing regression intercepts to 0 for multiple reasons. First, bobwhite males are known to exhibit densitydependent singing activity (Lituma et al. 2017). Thus, not hearing bobwhites does not necessarily imply absence. Alternatively, negative intercepts are biologically nonsensical within context. For all intents and purposes, we forced the intercepts to 0 in an exploratory analysis. Regression coefficients at the ranch scale changed little, while regression coefficients at the point scale increased drastically. Given the large variation in count data, this is hard to reconcile and would require a mixing of methods where some intercepts are restricted and others are not (see full reporting of count data in Table 1). Moreover, it is important to note that $95 \%$ confidence bands encompassed the origin for all regressions except for when relating autumn covey callcounts to minimum known populations. Therefore, our results do not necessarily refute an origin-based intercept.
We observed the strongest relationship between roadside surveys for both minimum known populations and markrecapture. Generally, these results tend to corroborate those of DeMaso et al. (2002), who found a strong relationship $\left(r^{2}=0.86\right)$ between TPWD roadside surveys and estimated statewide harvest. Though not of primary interest to our objectives, we evaluated the correlation between RPQRR and TPWD roadside surveys for the Rolling Plains ecoregion using a Spearman rank test. Roadside surveys at RPQRR during 2008-2017 $(n=10)$ were correlated ( $r=0.99$ ) with TPWD roadside surveys for the Rolling Plains ecoregion. Thus, it appeared that roadside surveys conducted by TPWD at the ecoregion scale were reliable for predicting population trends at RPQRR.

The short temporal difference between when roadside surveys (Sep) and helicopter surveys (Nov) were conducted in relation to when minimum known population and markrecapture data were collected (Nov-Dec) may explain such strong relationships to hunting-season abundance. This hypothesis has merit considering that we observed the weakest relationship when the temporal difference was greatest (i.e., spring cock counts and autumn abundance). Our results suggest spring cock call-counts and autumn covey call-counts were poor predictors of quail density surrounding survey points during January. It is likely that quail densities fluctuate spatially across the landscape between the time of an index (May-Jul, Sep) and when hunting densities are estimated (e.g., Jan). This may serve as an explanation as to why indices were better predictor of abundance (ranch scale) as opposed to density (point scale), and short-ranged predictors (e.g., roadside surveys) were better predictors of abundance than long-ranged predictors (e.g., spring cock call-counts). Collectively, our results support conclusions of DeMaso et al. (1992) and Rusk (2007) that audible indices are poor predictors of density but

may be used as crude predictors of overall autumn abundance.

The strength of the relationship between roadside surveys and autumn abundance $\left(r^{2}=0.98\right)$ was comparable to the relationship of helicopter surveys and autumn abundance ( $r^{2}=0.93$ ). Conceptually, the 2 survey methods (i.e., linetransect sampling) are the same. As such, for areas that have sufficient road systems, roadside surveys for bobwhite may have the potential to be translated into general density estimates, similar to efforts by DeMaso et al. (2010) with helicopter surveys. However, our study was limited to one study site, and future efforts would require multiple sites to develop a robust formula.

The use of indices is invaluable to stakeholders who may not have the technical expertise to adjust counts for calling rates, environmental conditions, and consequently, detection probability. Our study was limited to one ranch in the Rolling Plains of Texas. Thus, future research in the region should seek to develop more robust relationships among multiple sites and years for roadside counts and autumn covey counts, which we found to be the most promising bobwhite indices for our study area. For researchers and stakeholders planning bobwhite monitoring projects, we developed a project-cost worksheet for logistical reference (Table S1).
