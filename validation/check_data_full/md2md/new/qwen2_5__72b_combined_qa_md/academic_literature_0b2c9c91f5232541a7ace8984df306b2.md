#### Abstract

A B S T R A C T Mechanical properties of new composites having a binary matrix of $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu}$ reinforced with $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ nano particles were investigated. The composites which consisted of $2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ and $8 \mathrm{wt} \%$ of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ reinforcement particles, were fabricated using mechanical alloying and a powder metallurgy route. Morphology, phases and compounds formed during ball milling and densification of samples were studied. With increasing percentages of the reinforcement particles, mechanical properties of the composites were enhanced. Microstructural evolution and mechanical properties changes of the composites after application of twist extrusion (TE), as a severe plastic deformation (SPD) process, were also investigated. It was revealed that the more TE passes the higher hardness and yield strength obtained. In addition, increasing TE passes, led to occurrence of a more homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement particles within the structure, and development of an ultrafine-grained nano-structure. The maximum allowable number of TE passes was found to be four, above which the materials failed.

## 1. Introduction

In recent decades, aluminum matrix composites (AMC) with discontinuous reinforcements have vastly been attracted by different industries due to their good mechanical properties. Large number of manufacture routes have been developed to produce these materials among which powder metallurgy (PM) routes have been more considered with several causes. First, in powder metallurgy a controlled phase microstructure can be achieved. On the other hand, lower temperatures used in PM processes make the interphase kinetics be precisely controlled. In PM routes, the powders of elements and alloys are used which might be more inexpensive, and of course, much more effective in reinforcement of the composites. Traditional stages of PM-AMCs fabrication include mixing and blending the powders; degassing the solidified product in vacuum; homogenizing through hot pressing or hot isostatic pressing (HIP) [1].

AMCs are widely used in automotive, aerospace and transport industries because of their light weight, high elastic modulus, improved strength and good wear resistance. Strength and wear resistance of these materials are strongly dependent on volume fraction, size and type of reinforcement particles. They are well established that compared to their un-reinforced matrix alloys show higher wear resistance. AMCs with ceramic particles including $\mathrm{SiC}, \mathrm{TiC}, \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{~B}, \mathrm{TiB}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ are relatively easy to process and, in comparison with fiber-reinforced composites, are nearly isotropic $[2]$.

[^0]Particulate AMCs have introduced most wide spread applications and hold the greatest promise for future growth because of their tailored properties, low cost-effectiveness and high volume production methods [3]. Aluminum matrix composites are known to be hard materials exhibiting a low forming capacity through the conventional techniques. Nevertheless, many promising attempts have been made to produce Al composites with a high potential of being formed plastically and even superplastically while their strength is retained [4].

Mechanical alloying (MA) is an interesting powder metallurgy route for producing of powders with high homogeneity and uniformity. This technique is very effective in dispersion of reinforcement particles and enhances grain refinement, which induces an increase of strength and hardness [5].

In recent years, manifestation of severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods in material science has shed light on new prospects in achieving a unique combination of high strength and ductility [6] as well as attaining ultrafine-grained materials with improved properties. SPD is a family of metal forming techniques that use extensive hydrostatic pressure to impose a very high strain on bulk solids, producing exceptional grain refinement without introducing any significant change in the overall dimensions of the sample

To investigate mechanical properties of the composites and to plot true stresstrue strain relation, compression tests were carried out. The cylindrical compression samples were cut from the centre of the billets for 1, 2 and 4 cycles with ratio of $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{D}=1$, separately out of the samples containing 2 and $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and, then were prepared and polished. The tests were conducted at ambient temperature. True stress-true strain relation of samples in each pass were inferred from compressive stress-strain curves.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Powders specifications

Firstly, to determine the adequate milling duration, aluminum powder and $4 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{Cu}$ powder were mixed and ball-milled for 5,6 and 8 h . The XRD patterns are compared in Fig. 2a. As seen, with increasing the milling time, the XRD peak intensities for aluminum and copper phases decreased and the XRD peak intensity of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{Cu}$ phase increased, therefore, it is inferred that after 8 h milling, the phase $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{Cu}$ was formed and alloying process was completed. Now, $2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ reinforcement powder was added to the mixture and milled for 4 more hours (two-stage alloying). Next, aluminum, copper and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ powders were mixed together and were milled in two portions for 12 and 16 h (one-stage alloying). Compressive results are shown in Fig. 2b. In two-stage conditions, as observed in Table 2, the subgrain size is smaller, but formation of $\mathrm{Al}_{7} \mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}$ brittle phase occurred that might be due to gradual intrusion of Fe into the mixture during ball-milling through surface erosion of the balls and cups. On the other hand, the weak signs of the formation of that phase were observed in one-stage milling for 16 h . Therefore, to minimize the possible formation of the deleterious brittle phase of $\mathrm{Al}_{7} \mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}$ in the final product, all samples were produced through one-stage, 16 h ball-milling. In Fig. 2c, the results of X-ray diffraction experiments for milling of $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{Cu}$ powder mixture containing $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ for 16 h are depicted. The results indicated the formation of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{Cu}$ phase which witnesses that the alloying was performed successfully. The deleterious brittle phase of $\mathrm{Al}_{7} \mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}$ was not observed in the final product.

### 3.2. Evaluation of composites

For hot compacting, the twist extruded samples having $2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}{ }_{2}$, first, temperature of $550^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and, then $580^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ were applied. Densities of those samples were calculated using dipping-in-water procedure (Eqs. (2) and (3)) and, since their measured densities at above two temperatures were found to be very low ( $<97 \%$ ), higher temperatures were applied. The applied pressure for all samples was fixed at 700 MPa for 30 min . Porosity volume fraction was also determined using Eq. (3); the results are presented in Table 3. For applying a uniform axial pressure, the ratio of height to diameter ( $h / d$ ) was about 1.5 .
$\rho=\frac{W_{\text {air }} \rho_{\text {water }}-0.0012}{0.99983\left(W_{\text {air }}-W_{\text {water }}\right)+0.0012}$
$\rho_{T}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_{i} \rho_{i}$
$\% \text { Porosity }=\frac{\rho_{T}-\rho}{\rho_{T}} \times 100$
where $W_{\text {air }}$ is the measured weight of the sample in air, $W_{\text {water }}$ the weight in water, $\rho$ measured density, $\rho_{\text {water }}$ density in water, $\rho_{T}$ theoretical density. In hot compression test performed on composite, temperature of $640^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ was applied for the other samples, but their holding time in the furnace increased to 60 and 120 min .

was nearly equal to the theoretical density of the composite. Therefore, the same conditions were repeated for the mixture powder containing $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ reinforcement. Because the density of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ particles was higher than that of the matrix alloy $\left(4.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, it was anticipated that with increasing volume fraction of reinforcement particles, the relative density of the composite increased [5] which was consistent with the results depicted in Table 4.

Fig. 3 shows SEM micrographs of the samples containing $2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ prior to TE with coarse distinct grains. As seen, the reinforcement particles are distributed uniformly within the matrix. The particles became finer with smooth edges and corners during ball-milling. Uniform distribution of nanoparticles within matrix, because of their high surface to volume

ratio, is difficult. In the composites with $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, distribution of these nano-particles was inhomogeneous resulting in formation of their large agglomerates; these usually impair mechanical properties of materials. This is more evident in Fig. 4.

According to XRD results shown in Fig. 5a, presence of the brittle phase (i.e. $\mathrm{Al}_{7} \mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}$ in the sintered $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 2 \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ sample, which causes brittle fracture of the material, is confirmed. However, X-ray diffraction pattern in Fig. 5b indicates that in the $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 8 \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ sample, the brittle phase is absent. In the next stages of experiments, it will be noticed that with application of severe plastic strains, fracture of latter samples occurred more frequently in comparison with the former ones. For performing quantitative analysis of the existing elements in the samples, EDX was utilized. The results are depicted in Fig. 5(c) and (d) as well as in Table 5. Those results were obtained from surfaces of the samples showing the total weight percentage of the elements in the sintered samples. The analysis showed no contamination.

Fig. 6(a) shows secondary electron (SE) micrograph of a sample with composition of $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 2 \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ together with EDX analyses of points A and B (specified with circles), which are nearly identical. Therefore, it is concluded that the reinforcing particles are uniformly distributed within the matrix, as mentioned earlier. However, EDX analyses of points A and B of SE micrograph of the sample $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 8 \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ shown in Fig. 6(b) are quite dissimilar. It means that a non-uniform distribution of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ nano-particles coupled with their large agglomerates, which usually contribute to deterioration of mechanical properties of the composite, occurred.

Compression true stress-true strain curves of the annealed samples, in the case of $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} /$ $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ are illustrated and compared in Fig. 7 and the results are shown in Table 6. It is evident that with increasing $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content in the composite, yield stress and Young modulus increase but, ductility decreases. Perhaps, deletion of porosities during hot compression at $640^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 120 min was effective in enhancement of the sample strength. On the other hand, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ particles are stable thermodynamically, and do not react with the matrix phase at high temperatures. These particles act as barriers against movement

of dislocations leading to ductility decrease [25].
Fig. 8 shows variation of lost volume of composites during wear test vs. sliding distance. As previously shown, with increasing the percentage of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ reinforcement, the lost volume decreases. To predict wear coefficient, Eq. (1) was used. The graph in Fig. 9 shows variation of wear coefficient with sliding distance for all samples. As indicated, the lowest wear coefficient belongs to the composite having $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$. It is also evident in Table 7 that with increasing weight percentage of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ particles, the hardness of the material increases. Such a hardness increasing can be attributed to the increasing of dislocation densities improving material resistance. Hardness increasing leads to enhancement of wear resistance of the composite [25].

regions. EDX examinations revealed that the two discrete dark and light regions corresponding to $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ clusters and the matrix, respectively. Fig. 10(a), (b), (e) and (f) shows the microstructure of two composites in central area after two passes and four passes of twist extrusion, respectively. It is revealed that grains became finer and the microstructure was more uniform with increasing the number of TE passes and this is same for Fig. 10(c), (d), (g) and (h) that illustrate the microstructure of lateral region of cross-section of both composites after two passes and four passes of TE, respectively. After four passes of TE in both composites, formation of nano-sized grains are evident. Unlike significant effect of billet axial rotations between ECAP passes [26,27], the billet rotations between TE passes have no effect on the plastic flow. This is due to the axial symmetry of the process.

Clustering of fine particles has been reported by Ritasalo et al. [28]. With increasing twist extrusion passes, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ clusters became smaller having a more homogeneous distribution in the matrix. For the sample $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, as observed, with increasing the number of TE passes, very fine equiaxed grains are formed. It is also evident that in the centre of the sample, the microstructure is less homogeneous and the formation of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ clusters is observed. As indicated, in both types of samples, the microstructures in the corners and edges of the cross-section are more homogenous than those in the centers. This means that the corners experienced larger strains compared to the centre. In each pass of TE process, applying plastic deformation leads to an increase in dislocation density and, consequently formation of subgrains that impede dis-

With accumulation of plastic strains in subsequent passes, misorientation between neighboring grains increases and elongated grains turn to fine equiaxed ones resulting in a recrystallized microstructure [29]. This is the same phenomenon normally observed in SPD processes and is termed dynamic recrystallization [30].

Mishra et al. [29] suggested that when grains become smaller and also when the total area of grain boundaries increases, discrete dislocations emitted by a boundary are absorbed by the opposite grain boundary. Therefore, in higher passes of TE, dislocation density decreases gradually and high angle grain boundaries form. Shape of grains and rate of converting low angle boundaries to high angle ones in TE process depend on twist path and twist angle ( $\alpha$ ). It is worth noting that strain distribution and the boundary of deformation zones depend strongly on the geometry of die crosssection, i.e. deviation angle ( $\beta$ ) and twist angle ( $\alpha$ ), and by varying these factors, one can change strain intensity in different regions.

Grain sizes of the extruded samples were determined after each TE pass using a scaling-measuring utility installed to scanning electron microscope, as shown in Fig. 11 and the results are depicted in Table 8. It is inferred from Table 8 that with increasing TE passes, grain size in the centre and in the corners decreases. However, with increase of passes, the amount of strain that can be imposed on the sample, decreases. Such a decrease is further observed at edge

regions. Therefore, uniformity of deformed structure increases and gradually, extent of grain refinement increases in central and lateral regions of the sample. This is due to structure stability brought about by saturation of the mechanical properties after the strain exceeds saturation limit. Such stability and saturation are not confined to TE, but are extended to all deformations based on pure shear like ECAP and so on. Mechanisms of this effect in PSD processes are such that with increasing passes (i.e. with increasing the strains), grain boundary surfaces also increase with a rate proportional to deformation state. During plastic deformation, cells or subgrains form and after a rather large strain, a considerable change does not occur in them. Therefore, with increasing strain, amount of high angle boundaries increases [29]. It is then concluded that with increasing the number of passes, the difference in grain sizes decreases in various regions of the sample. To determine extent of this difference in various passes, a variable index ( $V$ ) is defined as a ratio of standard deviation, $S D$ to a parameter average value $\bar{x}$ as follows [31]:
$V=\frac{S D}{\bar{x}} \times 100$
Fig. 12 shows inhomogeneity of grain size for different passes and various $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ contents in composites. As indicated, the annealed sample is more homogeneous in grain size and, the sample extruded for one pass shows highest inhomogeneity. It is evident that with increasing the number of passes, the inhomogeneity of grain size decreases to a minimum of $V=\sim 16 \%$ for fourpass TE operation.

Fig. 13(a) shows the effect of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content on Vickers microhardness of the composites. A more uniform dispersion of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ particle in the matrix impedes dislocation movements resulting in an increase of the hardness [32]. Fig. 13(b) and (c) shows the variation of hardness in the centre and corners of cross-section as well as mean hardness, in different passes of TE, for both types of composites. As seen, during first pass, the hardness increases dramatically, but in next passes, an obvious decrease in the curve slope is observed. This has been attributed to increase in dislocation density resulted from application of severe plastic deformation [29].

Since corners get higher plastic strains than the centre, they possess higher hardness. However, with increasing the number of passes and gradual saturation of microstructure with strain due to saturation in dislocation density and, then development of a fine substructure, the heterogeneity in hardness distribution on the cross-section of the sample decreases. Therefore, despite occurrence of heterogeneity in deformation, hardness distribution is homogeneous at higher strains. Zendehdel et al. also reported homogeneity of hardness distribution at higher passes when they investigated influence of TE process on microstructure and mechanical properties of 6063 aluminum alloy [33]. Fig. 14(a) and (b) illustrates Vickers microhardness measured along diagonal line on cross-section of different samples. As indicated, hardness of samples increased noticeably after first pass compared to the annealed specimens. For the samples containing $2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, the hardness increased by $52 \%$ in average, but for the sample having $8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$, the hardness increasing was $46 \%$. The hardness increase is lower for the central regions that undergoes lower strain levels and, higher for the lateral areas deformed by higher strains; this is due to higher redundant strains ( $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}$ ) at the lateral regions [34]. The variation index, $V$, is also defined for description of heterogeneity level in hardness values. Using the variation index, $V$, calculated through Eq. (5) for different passes, Table 9 for the sample $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and Table 10 for the sample $\mathrm{Al}-4 \mathrm{Cu} / 8 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ are tabulated. Fig. 15 shows the heterogeneity index of hardness values $(V)$ for different passes of TE. It is inferred from Tables 9
