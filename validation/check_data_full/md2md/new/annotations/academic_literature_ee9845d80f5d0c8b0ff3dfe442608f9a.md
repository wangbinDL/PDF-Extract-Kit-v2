Abstract-An organic-mineral composite of hydroxyapatite $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{10}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right)$ nanoparticles and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is synthesized via coprecipitation from a solution containing $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$, aqueous ammonia, $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}$, and CMC. The composition and microstructure of the composite and the lattice parameters and particle size of the hydroxyapatite are determined using x-ray diffraction, chemical analysis, IR spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques, electron diffraction, and $\mathrm{x}$-ray microanalysis. The hydroxyapatite nanoparticles are shown to form agglomerates about $200 \mathrm{~nm}$ in size. The interaction between the nanoparticles and CMC macromolecules leads to the formation of a pore structure potentially attractive for biomedical applications.

## INTRODUCTION

In the past few decades, a great deal of attention has been paid to bone substitute materials engineering [1]. Even though autogenic implants offer a number of advantages, their application in prosthetics requires surgical procedures for taking bone grafts. At the same time, the use of allogenic bone graft materials involves the risks of infection and immune reactions, which may impede healing and carry a health hazard [2]. Even biocompatible implant materials are subject to the influence of fibrous tissue, resulting in their encapsulation, which impedes adhesion and may lead to bioactivity loss and isolation of the implant from the surrounding bone tissue $[3]$.

These difficulties can be overcome by using synthetic implant materials based on hydroxyapatite (HA), $\mathrm{Ca}_{10}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$, a bioactive compound capable of forming chemical bonds with surrounding tissue, without generating immune reactions in the human body [1, $4,5]$. Synthetic HA is used as implant material in the form of powders and dense or porous ceramics $[1,6]$. Recently, HA nanoparticles have been shown to be attractive for practical application $[7,8]$. Owing to their small size and high specific surface area, HA nanoparticles, similar in many aspects to the HA nanoparticles of bone tissue, effectively interact with living cells, which opens up unique possibilities of treating some complex bone defects [9]. Among the drawbacks to implant materials based on HA nanoparticles are their instability, associated with the migration of the nanoparticles to surrounding tissue under the action of the blood flow [10], and their low solubility, inferior to the solubility of other calcium phosphates, e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ [11]. The HA solubility can be enhanced by introducing $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ and other impurity phases into implants [12, 13] or by using organic-mineral composites (OMCs) of HA and natural [14-16] or synthetic [17-19] polymers.

Of particular interest are OMCs based on polysaccharides owing to the biocompatibility, bioresorbability, plasticity, and good adhesion of these organic polymers $[20,21]$ and also to some of their unique characteristics, particularly the ability to form bonds with cartilage tissue [22] and suitability for producing OMCs with controlled HA solubility in blood plasma [23].

The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a natural polymer with the general formula $\left[\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{OH})_{3-x}\left(\mathrm{OCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}\right)_{x}\right]_{n}(x=0.08-1.5)$ [11], on HA precipitation from aqueous solutions and also the effect of synthesis and processing conditions on the basic physicochemical properties of the resultant OMCs.

## EXPERIMENTAL

Composites of HA and CMC (Aldrich, cat. no. 32,306-3 [9004-32-4]) were prepared via precipitation from a solution containing $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$, aqueous ammonia, $\mathrm{CMC}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%)$, and $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{HPO}_{4}(0.05 \mathrm{M})$ at $\mathrm{pH} 10$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}: \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}=1.67$. The process was run in a closed glass vessel at room temperature for 14 days with constant stirring (magnetic stirrer with a Tefloncoated stir bar). During synthesis, we monitored the $\mathrm{pH}$,calcium content (chelatometric titration), and phosphorus content (quinoline molybdate gravimetric method) of the solution [24]. Next, the solution was left standing for $24 \mathrm{~h}$, and the resultant precipitate was collected on a filter, washed with distilled water, and dried in air at room temperature. The powder was then placed in a platinum dish and heat-treated at $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $2 \mathrm{~h}$ in air.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a DRON-4 automated diffractometer $\left(\mathrm{Cu} K_{\alpha}\right.$ radiation, graphite monochromator, EXPRESS data acquisition program). In phase analysis, we used the PHAN and PHAN\% programs (modified full-profile analysis, block size $D_{h k l}$, and lattice strain) [25]. The block size and residual lattice strain $\langle\varepsilon 2\rangle^{1 / 2}$ were evaluated by separating their contributions to the width of the intrinsic diffraction profile, which are known to be different functions of the Bragg angle: $D_{h k l} \sim k \lambda / \beta_{D} \cos \theta ;\left\langle\varepsilon^{2}\right\rangle^{1 / 2} \sim$ $\beta_{\langle\varepsilon\rangle} \cot \theta$, where $k$ is the form factor, $\beta_{D}$ is the particlesize broadening, $\beta_{\langle\varepsilon\rangle}$ is the strain broadening, and $\theta$ is the Bragg angle $[25]$.

The surface morphology of OMC specimens was examined on a CamScanS4 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Elemental composition was determined using a Link Analytical energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis system. Microstructures were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction on a JEOL JEM 1210.

Thermal analysis (DTA + TG) was carried out with ULVAK SINKU-RIKO TGD 7000 system in air at a heating rate of $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$, using $30-$ to $50-\mathrm{mg}$ samples placed in platinum crucibles.

IR absorption spectra were measured from 400 to $4000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ on a Specord-M80 spectrophotometer. The samples were prepared as $\mathrm{KBr}$ or Nujol mulls.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The precipitation product had the form of white paste. During air drying, its strength increased to the level of ceramics and bone.

According to JCPDS data (card no. 9-432) [26], well-crystallized stoichiometric HA is characterized by three well-resolved peaks near $2 \theta \simeq 32^{\circ}$, those at $2 \theta \simeq$ $31.83^{\circ}, 32.10^{\circ}$, and $32.90^{\circ}$. The poor resolution and broad reflections in this angular range in the XRD pattern of the OMC (Fig. 1a) attest to poor crystallinity of the HA (close to that of bone tissue [8]), texturing, and the formation of aggregates $(\simeq 200 \mathrm{~nm})$ of HA nanoparticles $(\simeq 12 \mathrm{~nm})$. At the same time, the XRD pattern of the OMC (Fig. 1a) contains no peaks from $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$, $\mathrm{CaO}$, or $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$, typical by-products in HA synthesis [1], indicating that, under the conditions of this study, the reaction in solution reaches completion. The presence of the amorphous component, CMC, influences only the intensity of the XRD peaks (Fig. 1b). The lattice parameters of the HA (table) differ very litthe from those reported in [26] for stoichiometric HA and in [23, 27] for HA prepared by other procedures. The nanoparticles in the OMC synthesized in this work are smaller than the HA nanoparticles obtained by Murugan and Ramakrishna [23] (table).

Given that the XRD pattern of the OMC shows most of the peaks characteristic of stoichiometric HA, we conclude that CMC macromolecules produce no drastic changes in the structure of the HA. At the same time, the presence of CMC influences the shape of the XRD peaks from HA and its lattice parameters, suggesting that CMC interacts with the forming HA. This assumption is also supported by the results for OMCs based on HA and other calcium phosphates, synthesized in aque-ous solutions in the presence of macromolecules close in composition to CMC $[16,17]$. During synthesis, the hydroxyl groups of the macromolecules, interacting primarily with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions in the mother solution, act as crystallization centers. The resulting calcium phosphates are, as a rule, metastable and decompose on heating. The assumption that HA and CMC react during synthesis is also supported by the fact that the HA decomposes during heat treatment $\left(1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 2 \mathrm{~h}\right)$. Although the XRD pattern of the heat-treated material shows a number of sharp peaks (Fig. 1c), it provides no evidence for the formation of HA or its mixtures with other phosphates.

The IR spectrum of the as-prepared OMC (Fig. 2, spectrum 1) also points to the formation of HA as a result of precipitation from solution. At intermediate wavenumbers, the spectrum shows all of the peaks arising from the hydroxyl $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$ and phosphate $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}\right)$ groups of HA. The absorption bands characteristic of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ [28] are present at $470,571,603,962,1035$, and $1090 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Fig. 2, spectrum 1). The bending and stretching modes of the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ group are observed at 3575 and $634 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively. The broad absorption bands centered around 1640 and $3447 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ arise from the water adsorbed by the HA.

The vibrational spectrum of CMC (Fig. 2, spectrum 2) can be used to analyze the effect of polysaccharide molecules on OMC formation. The presence of CMC leads to broadening of the absorption band at $3100-3500 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ on the low-frequency side (3100-$3300 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ) owing to the overlap with the stretching band corresponding to the free or combined $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ groups of the polysaccharide (Fig. 3) [29]. At the same time, the absorption bands at 2890 and $2857 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, characteristic of $\mathrm{CMC}$ (cellulose-O- $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{C}_{\backslash}^{\prime \prime} \mathrm{O}$ ) and arising from the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ stretches in the $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups, are missing in the IR spectrum of the composite. The symmetric bending mode of the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds in the methyl groups of the modified cellulose (CMC) gives rise to strong absorption near $1440 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and a characteristic peak at $925 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (Fig. 2, spectrum 2),which are missing in the spectrum of unmodified cellulose [21]. Note that, in the IR spectrum of the composite, these bands are extremely weak. The strong absorption peaked at $1420 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and the weak features at 880 , 1465 , and $2000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are attributable to vibrational modes of the $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ ions $[30,31]$ resulting from the reaction between HA and polysaccharide macromolecules. At the same time, the bands at $1420\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right)$ and $1640 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ cannot be assigned uniquely because CMC also has strong absorption bands in those spectral regions: one of them $\left(1440 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)$ arises from the symmetric vibrations of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$, and the other $\left(1600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)$ is due to the stretching mode of the $\mathrm{COO}^{-}$ group [28]. It seems, therefore, likely that, during the reaction with the inorganic component and the formation of HA, the cellulose molecules remain intact, without producing undesirable impurities. The presence of $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ ions in the HA of the composite is permissible because this leads to the formation of bioapatite close in composite to type $B$ [32]. The proposed assignment is supported by the fact that, after heat treatment at $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, all of the above-mentioned bands are missing, except for the bands arising from $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and a weak feature around $2000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right)$ (Fig. 2, spectrum 3).

The TG and DTA curves of CMC (Fig. 4a) and OMC (Fig. 4b) show a weight loss in the range 70-$150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a characteristic endothermic peak at $125^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, both due to sample dehydration. Similar features were reported for other OMCs, in particular those containing polysaccharides [16]. In the range $250-600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a second step of rapid weight loss occurs, which reaches completion above $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The overall weight loss on heating to above $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is about $15 \%$, in reasonable agreement with the initial CMC content. The distinctions between the DTA curves of the starting polysaccharide and OMC are typical of systems of this kind [16] and can be understood in terms of the transformations of CMC in the course of synthesis (formation of CMC macromolecules and interaction with HA nanoparticles). Nearly all of the CMC decomposes by $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At the same time, the samples heat-treated at $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ contain trace levels of organics. Given that HA decomposes during heat treatment, as determined by $\mathrm{XRD}$, these findings may be interpreted as evidence that CMC and HA react in the course of synthesis.

The HA nanoparticles in the OMC seem to form agglomerates about $200 \mathrm{~nm}$ in size (Figs. 5a, 5b). Agglomeration is also evidenced by TEM and electron diffraction results (Figs. 5c-5e). The agglomerates (Fig. 5d) form a porous structure (Fig. 5a) with a pore size ranging from 1 to $3 \mu \mathrm{m}$ and a characteristic surface morphology. According to earlier reports [1, 2, 23], such pore structures of OMCs are best suited for the interaction of OMC-based implants with tissue and contribute to the stabilization of HA in implants.

X-ray microanalysis results (Fig. 5b) demonstrate that the samples are uniform in composition. The elements identified the OMC are carbon, calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen. The last three elements are characteristic of the inorganic component of the OMC (HA).

The agglomeration of the HA nanoparticles can be accounted for under the assumption that the HA reacts with CMC macromolecules and that the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ groups of CMC are involved in HA formation. It is known [29] that, in solutions similar to those in which we prepared the OMC, macromolecules of the CMC sodium salt used in this work have the form of elongated coils (Fig. 5f). According to the Kun model [29], the length of hypothetical linear portions is then $A_{m}=13-18 \mathrm{~nm}$ (about 25 constitutional units of cellulose), which is close to the size of the HA nanoparticles. The moirÃ© fringes [33] present in the electron diffraction pattern (Fig. 5e) are due to the interference between different parts of the electron beam diffracted by HA nanoparticles close in orientation. Similar results were reported for other OMCs $[34,35]$. One possible explanation is that HA nanoparticles are attached to some portions of a coiled cellulose molecule, which are comparable in size to the agglomerates of HA nanoparticles (on the order of $200 \mathrm{~nm}$ ).

## CONCLUSIONS

We developed a viable approach to the synthesis of novel implant materials-composites of HA nanoparticles and CMC-via coprecipitation from solution at room temperature. This process mimics in vitro the nucleation of HA nanocrystals in the course of osteogenesis and makes it possible to resolve a number of important issues pertaining to the application of nanocrystalline HA in bone implants. First, OMCs based on polysaccharides markedly enhance the solubility of HA [23] and, hence, the effectiveness of the implant. Second, implants based on the synthesized OMC are expected to have enhanced performance owing to the hindered migration of HA nanoparticles to surrounding tissue because of the formation of chemical bonds between the HA nanoparticles and CMC macromolecules. Third, the high strength of the OMC, comparable to the strength of ceramics, makes it possible to envisage many in vivo applications for this composite as a material for bioresorbable implants with high bioactivity and osteoconductivity. Finally, our results open up many possible applications for natural polysaccharides in advanced medical technologies.
