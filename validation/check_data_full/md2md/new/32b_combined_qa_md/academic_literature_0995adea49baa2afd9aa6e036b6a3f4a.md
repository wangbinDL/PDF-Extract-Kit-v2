tioned above may also be interpreted by suggesting a heterogeneity of GABA receptors in vertebrates ${ }^{6}$. Thus, different types of GABA receptors may exist, those linked to the benzodiazepine receptor, and others which are independent from benzodiazepine receptors. The latter may be different types of GABA receptors, or they could be 'floating' 'standard' GABA receptors which occur in the same membranes, but are not functionally coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.

## Coupling of the benzodiazepine receptor to the GABA receptor ionophore

Anions may also modify benzodiazepine receptor binding. Chloride and several other anions, especially halides, enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptor by enhancing the affinity to their binding sites $^{7}$. The selectivity of these effects of anions on benzodiazepine receptor binding has been suggested to be in agreement with their selectivity for their penetration through inhibitory postsynaptic membranes of cat motoneurones measured electrophysiologically ${ }^{8}$. These observations have led to the concept that benzodiazepine receptors are closely linked to the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor ${ }^{8}$. The fact that picrotoxin has no effect on GABA or benzodiazepine receptor binding suggests that the ionophore associated with the GABA receptor is a separate functional unit, which may be influenced by other types of drugs.

## Search for an endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors

Just as the discovery of the morphine receptor led to the subsequent isolation of the endorphins, the discovery of benzodiazepine receptors suggested the existence of an endogenous ligand for these receptors. In the search for such an endogenous ligand, extracts from brain tissue were found to contain low molecular weight and heat stable compounds which resisted degradation by proteolytic enzymes and which were competitive inhibitors of benzodiazepine receptor binding ${ }^{5,8}$. In crude brain extracts the regional distribution of endogenous compounds which interfere with benzodiazepine binding is similar to that of benzodiazepine receptor binding sites in vivo and in vitro ${ }^{2}$. Some of these compounds have been identified as hypoxanthine and inosine ${ }^{8}$. However, the low affinity of hypoxanthine and inosine for benzodiazepine receptors is difficult to reconcile with their putative role as endogenous ligands since brain concentrations of these substances are lower than those required to inhibit benzodiazepine binding, although they may be sufficiently high in some critical brain compartments. Furthermore, hypoxanthine and inosine levels might change significantly during stress or ischaemia. The pharmacological and behavioural effects of hypoxanthine and inosine are largely unexplored. Thus, until now, the search for an endogenous ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor has not yet let to the discovery of endogenous compounds which have potent agonistic or antagonistic effects compared with the benzodiazepines. In addition, the modulatory protein, which appears to desensitize the GABA receptor, also inhibits benzodiazepine receptor binding, although in higher concentrations ${ }^{2}$.

## Conclusions

There is now strong evidence that benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological effects in the CNS by interacting with a specific benzodiazepine receptor which is localized on neurones. This receptor appears to be part of a larger complex consisting of several sites include the benzodiazepine receptor, a GABA receptor, and the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor. A number of functional interactions between these sites have been described which seem to point to the concept of a more complex and modulated GABA receptor. The benzodiazepines appear to exert their pharmacological effects by altering the functional state of this benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.
