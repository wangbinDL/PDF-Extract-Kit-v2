#### Abstract

A B S T R A C T Sol-gel-derived porous carbon is an attractive electrode material for various applications because its structure, along with its physical properties, can be tailored to the specified task by selecting suitable precursors and synthesis conditions. To complement oil shale-based sol-gel materials, in the current study, the tunability of the properties of 5-methylresorcinol-formaldehyde (5MR-FA) carbon xerogel is examined. As expected, the porosity of the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel is lower than those of the corresponding carbon aerogels, but the specific surface area in the range of $2-417 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and the electrical conductivity of $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ demonstrate the potential of this xerogel in electrochemical applications as an electrode material. Furthermore, the synthesis conditions and final structure of the resulting carbon were in satisfactory correlation, including with the results of spectroscopy analysis. $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is used as a catalyst in this sol-gel reaction, affects the structure of the resulting carbon. In this study, it was established that the oxidation level of carbon and the short-range structural order and disorder are also influenced by the amount of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is supported by the trends in the electrical conductivity results.

## Introduction

The fabrication of porous materials via the sol-gel synthesis route has enabled the tuning of the structure and properties of the resulting materials via the selection of suitable concentrations of components in the precursor solution. The solid network that forms from the colloidal solution depends on the concentration of the precursor monomers and the solution pH [1], and this property has motivated numerous studies on tuning sol-gel-derived carbon materials for applications in energy conversion [2-4] and storage [5-8]. Sol-gel-derived microporous carbons in the form of carbon aerogels have enabled the realization of high specific surface areas of over $700 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, which can be increased further if required ( $\geq 3000 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ [9]) by increasing the microporosity (IUPAC classification, pores with diameters of $<2 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) using physical or chemical activation [9,10]. The high microporosity of carbonaceous materials, however, is not always the primary feature when pursuing the best performance. For example, in battery electrodes, in the case of high microporosity, the initially increased specific capacitance

[^0]is accompanied by a large irreversible charge capacity upon cycling, and samples with electrodes from carbon with reduced microporosity have shown a more stable and higher reversible charge capacity instead [11,12]. The sparse structure of carbon can also result in reduced electrical conductivity of the material. Thus, in various scenarios, as an alternative to highly porous carbon aerogel fabrication, xerogel-type carbon can be an alternative material with more suitable properties and lower processing costs [13]. To produce an aerogel, a wet gel is dried out under supercritical conditions to maintain the highly porous structure of the gel, which often precedes a time-consuming solvent exchange step [8]. A xerogel is obtained by drying the gel directly at ambient temperature and pressure. Organic aerogels and xerogels are converted into carbon aerogels and carbon xerogels (CXs), respectively, via a process that is called pyrolysis, in which at high temperature in an inert atmosphere, carbon scaffold is formed due to leaving of heteroatoms and functional groups. Compared to the corresponding carbon aerogel, CX is denser and has a lower total pore volume [13].

The effects of the pH and the overall concentration of the sol on the structural properties of CX have been well studied for the resorcinol-formaldehyde system [14-16]. In a synthesis of

Correlations between the catalyst concentration and density of carbon xerogel (CX) and carbon aerogel (CA) [25] samples at precursor solution concentrations of $H_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=25(\mathrm{a}), H_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=45(\mathrm{~b})$ and $H_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=65$ (c)
ples CX-30-25 and CX-60-25. A low-pressure hysteresis loop corresponds to the irreversible uptake of adsorbate molecules in adsorbent pores that are of the same size as the adsorbate molecules. Therefore, for these two samples, the $S_{B E T}$ value can be inaccurate.

The correlations between the total porosity, specific surface area (Table 3) and the sample density are clearly identified (Fig. 3 a, b and c), along with the correlation between the density and catalyst concentration in the precursor solution-the lower the 5MR/ $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ratio, the higher the density of CX. Comparing the influence of the precursor solution concentration on the final density of the carbon xerogel, for $5 M R / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=60$ and 90 , a higher $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ ratio leads to a lower density; at $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=30$, the influence is marginal.

As expected, the density of CX is much higher than the density of the corresponding carbon aerogel [25] (Fig. 3), but the correlation between the density and the catalyst concentration, along with the precursor solution concentration, is more pronounced for the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel. Thus, tailoring the 5MR-FA carbon xerogel in terms of density and porosity is straightforward, which can be an advantage compared to tailoring carbon aerogels. However, in contrast to 5MR-FA carbon aerogels, monolithic carbon xerogel samples could not be obtained due to capillary forces breaking the gel structure during water evaporation under ambient conditions.

gel. The elemental compositions of the samples are presented in Table 4 . The correlation between the Na and O weight percentages is linear (Fig. S2), but the total percentage of measured oxygen in CX is divided between $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and the carbon structure. After subtracting the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ contribution from the EDX results, the oxygen concentration in CX remains higher in the case of a higher $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration: the maximum $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{C}$ is 0.27 (CX-3025) (Table 4). Hence, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ hinders the graphitization of CX and the removal of oxygen from the xerogel structure. Compared to oxidized graphite ( $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{C}$ is 0.47 ) [40], the oxygen level in 5MR-FA CX is significantly lower; compared to resorcinol-based CX, the oxy-

gen content in 5MR-FA CX samples is higher. Resorcinol-based CX consists of $\geq 95 \%$ of carbon [41] after pyrolysis at $700^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but in the latter, roughly an order of magnitude lower catalyst concentration in the starting solution compared to 5 MR-CX allowed to expect that result. The trend of increased oxygen content in CX in the case of increased carbonate concentration has been explained by the activation effect of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is produced by decomposition of carbonate during pyrolysis, and which reacts with carbon structure forming various oxygen species. [42] The presence of oxygen in the carbon structure is favourable when further functionalization is targeted. Metallic impurities that originate from catalysts in the final carbon material can be avoided by selecting organic catalysts for adjusting the pH of the precursor solution [9,43]. Under the applied synthesis conditions, $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ remains in the final carbon material [44] and contributes to the physical properties of CX, as will be shown hereinafter.

At high catalyst concentrations $\left(5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=30\right)$ and high overall concentrations $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=25\right), \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is not distributed homogeneously in CX. Needle-like crystals that were rich in Na and O were observed in SEM images and an elemental mapping of CX-30-25— the areas of Na and O on the elemental map overlap (Fig. 4). At lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentrations, the distributions of Na and O atoms on the material grains became successively more uniform, and in the element mapping of CX-90-45, no needle-like crystals were observed (Fig. S3). The presence of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals and hindering effect of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ on graphitization aligns with the mechanism of carbothermic decomposition of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. [45,46]

## Structural order

Resorcinol-based sol-gel-derived carbon aerogels and xerogels are amorphous [47,48]. While structural ordering of such carbons can be influenced by the pyrolysis temperature and heteroatoms, graphitization can occur at temperatures below $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ only in the presence of graphitization catalysts [47,48]. Thus, layered graphitic structures in 5MR-FA CX are unlikely. The short-range structural order of 5MR-FA CX samples in terms of carbon-carbon bonding was investigated using micro-Raman spectroscopy. We have shown in previous work [49] that carbon particles that are prepared from 5MR-FA colloidal solution using a lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration than in this study $\left(5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=120\right)$ and a low overall concentration $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=90\right)$ give a single band at $1580 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the Raman spectrum, which is characteristic of monocrystalline graphite. The Raman spectra of 5MR-FA CX (Fig. 5) have features of nanocrystalline and amorphous carbons [30,31], and the spectra are similar to those of activated carbons [30], soot [34], carbon black [50] and graphene oxide (GO) [50,51], which all show a higher G band intensity than the D band intensity and a distinctive $2^{\text {nd }}$-order spectrum.

In Raman spectra of amorphous carbon, D and G bands at $1346 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $1585 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively, are characteristic. The G mode involves the in-plane bond-stretching motion (vibration mode of $\mathrm{E}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ symmetry) of pairs of $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ carbon atoms in aromatic and olefinic molecules [31]. The disorder-induced D band is related to the $\mathrm{A}_{1 \mathrm{~g}}$ breathing mode [31]. In the case of perfectly ordered graphite, in the first-order Raman spectrum, only a sharp G band can be observed, but with an increase in the amounts of defects and disorder in the carbon structure, the apparent G band broadens, and additional bands develop in the spectrum. [34, 50, 52-54] A second-order spectrum of CX samples in the range of approximately $2300-3200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ represents a combination of 2 broad bands. A well-defined 2D band (a second-order D band) at $\sim 2700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is always present in graphite with large crystals. [54] In ordered graphite samples, the 2 D band provides information regarding the order in the third dimension and the stacking of graphitic layers [55-57]. The appearance of the 2D band together with the D band in the spectrum has been explained by the presence of small graphitic crystal particles [58]. The band

The spectra are normalized according to the G-band intensity.
at $\sim 2900 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is associated with the $\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ band, which is induced by disorder [33,54]. In ordered carbon materials with only a few defects, another defect-related band $\left(\mathrm{D}^{\prime}\right)$ can be observed at $\sim 1620 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}[34,52,56,59-61]$, but in highly disordered carbons, the $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ band, which may merge with the G band, has not been observed [59,61], and it was not observed in the spectra of the 5MR-FA CX samples either.

For every considered $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ ratio (Fig. 5 a, b, c), reducing the catalyst concentration reduces the widths of the D and G bands. In the case of disordered $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ carbons, the $D$ and $G$ bands are broad, as is the whole second-order Raman spectrum. Narrowing of the bands is a sign of higher order in the carbon structure [58, 62]. In all samples, the intensity of the G band $(I(\mathrm{G}))$ is substantially higher than the intensity of the D band $(I(\mathrm{D}))$ (Fig. 5). This appears to be an effect of drying the gel under ambient conditions $[22,63-65]$ because such a pattern is not typically observed in Raman spectra (514 nm laser wavelength) of resorcinolformaldehyde-based low-density carbon aerogels [66,67]. A study by Zhang et al. showed that even in the case of graphene oxideresorcinol-formaldehyde composites, the intensity of the D band remains higher than that of the G band [66]. The D and G band locations in the spectra of all synthesized CX samples coincide. At equal $5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ratios, the depth of the valley between the D and G bands of the Raman spectra is similar among the samples (Fig. 5 d ); thus, the overall concentration of the precursor solution has less effect on the order of the CX structure than the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$.

To extract additional numerical information from the firstorder Raman spectra of the CX samples, 4 functions were fitted [30, 31, 34, 60-62] without fixing or limiting the range of any spectral parameter in the iteration process (deconvolved Raman spectra are presented in Fig. S4). In addition to the apparent G band at $\sim 1585 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, the D band was fitted by a narrow D 1 band at $\sim 1350 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and a broad D 2 subband at the same wavenumber. At $\sim 1550 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, a D 3 band was identified. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 5. The fitting algorithm did not identify the $\mathrm{D}^{\prime}$ band at $1620 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which supports the argument that the $5 \mathrm{MR}-\mathrm{FA}$ CX samples have disordered structures with only small crystallites. Fitting of the D band in the case of disordered carbons is a large source of inaccuracy, and the D band position and its intensity depend on the functions that are used [31]. Fitting the D band by a primary narrow D 1 band and a broad D 2 subband has previously been justified by the processes of single and double scattering, respectively, of the photoelectrons by the domain edge, which is responsible for the D band occurrence [32]. The probability of such double resonance decreases with the growth of the crystallite domain size ( $\mathrm{L}_{\alpha}$ limit $\sim 5 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), thereby suggesting that the investigated CX samples are nanocrystalline. The intensity of the D band, $I(\mathrm{D})$, is the sum of the intensities of the D 1 ( $I\left(\mathrm{D}_{1}\right)$ ) and D 2 ( $I\left(\mathrm{D}_{2}\right)$ ) bands [32] (Eq. 4).
$I(\mathrm{D})=I\left(\mathrm{D}_{1}\right)+I\left(\mathrm{D}_{2}\right)$
The Raman shifts of the $\mathrm{D}_{1}, \mathrm{D}_{2}$ and G bands for the analysed samples vary only slightly (the standard deviation in Table 5 is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ ). The G band shifts towards lower values as the oxygen concentration in the sample increases (except for CX-30-25). In the case of graphite, the increase in the level of oxidation shifts the G band maximum towards higher Raman shift values. [40, 68] Hence, we conclude that the synthesized CX samples are of higher disorder than graphite oxides: in the case of amorphous carbons, the position change of the G band towards a lower wavenumber (along with an increase in the G band width; Fig. 5) corresponds to an increase in disorder but can also correspond to a change in the size of aromatic domains [33]. Nevertheless, the Raman shift of the G band at $\sim 1590 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (as low as $1520 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ for amorphous carbons depending on the state of disorder [31]) and relatively narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) correspond to the presence of short-range order within CX samples [33].

The increase in the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration decreases the intensities of the D1 and G bands and increases the intensities of the D2 and D3 bands (Fig. 6). In the sum spectra, this translates to wider apparent D and G bands with a less steep "valley" between the bands (Fig. 5). The correlation between the intensities of the bands and the oxygen percentage in CX is almost linear (Fig. 6), except in the case of CX-30-25, which has the highest $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration ( $21 \% \mathrm{O}$ in CX ). The deviation is likely related to the presence of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals, as observed via SEM (Fig. 4). When part

of the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is in the form of needle-like crystals, the amount of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ that homogeneously spreads within CX is lower, and the overall effect of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ on $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonding is smaller. The intensities of $\mathrm{D} 1, \mathrm{G}, \mathrm{D} 2$ and D 3 of $\mathrm{CX}-30-25$ closely match the corresponding intensities of CX-60-25 with $11.5 \%$ O in CX.
The intensity of the D3 band at $1500-1550 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, which corresponds to a vibration mode that is detected in amorphous carbons [34], has been found to correlate with the level of oxygen content in graphene oxide [60]. In soot, the I(D3)/I(G) ratio has been related to the proportion of amorphous carbon [34]. Plotting the I(D3)/I(G) of 5MR-FA CX samples against the oxygen concentration (Fig. 7), an almost linear correlation is observed in the O range of $9-15 \%$, which well accords with those studies.

The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band is often used to calculate the size of crystallites, but in addition to crystallite size [31,32,54,69,70], the Raman response depends strongly on the amount of heteroatoms [70]; therefore, crystallite sizes will not be calculated for the CX samples in this study. The intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (I(D)/I(G)) characterizes the disorder in carbon materials. For the 5MR-FA CX samples, I(D)/I(G) increases approximately linearly with the oxygen concentration in the CX sample (Fig. 8).

Following Ferrari's and Robertson's three-stage model [31, 55], with the G band position at $\sim 1590 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, the increase in the $\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{D}) / \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{G})$ ratio can be interpreted as graphitic carbon developing nanocrystalline features and becoming less ordered or partially amorphous carbon developing nanocrystalline features and becoming more crystalline as the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration is increased. According to that model, the G band would shift towards higher wavenumbers in both cases. The G band at $1580 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the Ra-

man spectrum of 5MR-FA-based carbon nanoparticles with much lower $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration ( $\left.5 \mathrm{MR} / \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}=120, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=90\right)$ and monocrystalline graphitic structures [49] suggests that an increase in the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration ( CX samples) induces disorder. The position of the G band of individual CX samples appears to shift towards lower wavenumbers (Table 5) with increasing $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration, but in the model [31,55], the G band was fitted by a single function, while in the present study, the G band was fitted by the G and D3 bands.

When calculating $I(D) / I(G)$ ratios from the raw Raman spectra (Fig. 8), the trend remains similar to that in the fitted results. The values in the range of $0.82-0.95$ exceed those for amorphous and tetragonal amorphous carbons with high $\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ contents due to their crystallinity.

An additional view to crystallinity of samples was obtained from XRD analysis of CX samples. In Fig. 9, XRD patterns of CX$30-45$ and $\mathrm{CX}-90-25$ are presented. The patterns of both of the samples exhibit high background intensity and three weak and broad reflections, called hereafter as bands, at diffraction angles $2 \theta=22.6^{\circ}, 43.8^{\circ}$ and $79.6^{\circ}$, whereas the third band was barely visible. These bands can be explained by the presence of stacked graphitic layers in the CX samples. The profiles of each of the observed bands for both of these samples was well characterized by a single symmetric peak shape function (pseudo-Voigt, residual errors $R_{\text {wp }}=3-4 \%, R_{\text {expected }}=1.2-1.7 \%$ ). The first band, located at $\mathrm{d}=0.3917 \mathrm{~nm}$, was positioned between $\gamma$ and $\pi$ bands. The $\gamma$ band $\left(d_{\gamma}=0.44 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$ represents the packing distance of saturated structures such as aliphatic side chains and the $\pi$ band (denoted also as (002) band, $\mathrm{d}_{002}=0.3355 \mathrm{~nm}$ for crystalline graphite) reflects the spacing of aromatic ring layers in carbon materials [71-73]. Absence or undetectably low concentration of saturated aliphatic side chain structures in these samples could explain the symmetric shape of the first band and its assignment to the $\pi$ band. Since the broadening and position of the $\pi$ band considerably depends on the distortion factors of carbon atoms located at the aromatic ring layers [74], the observed shift of this band towards higher distance values compared to the position of this band in crystalline graphite refers to a defective structure of these samples. The CX samples, according to the classification method that uses positioning of carbon materials in an order/disorder scale based on the values of $\mathrm{d}_{002}$, belong to the range of disordered carbon materials ( $\mathrm{d}_{002}>0.35 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) [75]. The second and the third bands, arising from hexagonal ring structure of graphite, are located close to the 100, 101 and 110 reflections of graphite, respectively. These bands are often denoted as (10) and (110) or (11) [76].

Structural parameters of the sample CX-30-45, calculated from the position and broadening of the first two bands, are the following: $L_{c}=0.80(4) \mathrm{nm}, \quad L_{a}=2.6(2) \mathrm{nm}, d_{002}=0.392 \mathrm{~nm},<n_{s}>=2$. The parameters of the sample CX-90-25 are: $L_{c}=0.90(4) \mathrm{nm}$, $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{a}}=3.1(2) \mathrm{nm}, \mathrm{d}_{002}=0.394 \mathrm{~nm},<\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{s}}>=2$. These results suggest that the crystallites of CX samples are composed of about two stacked graphitic layers that are separated, on an average, by 0.393 nm . Distortions in the positions of carbon atoms and the small size of the graphite like structures in the samples are probably the reason why about a $17 \%$ increase of this distance, compared to that for crystalline graphite, was observed. The sample CX-30-45 showed a bit lower crystallinity compared to that of the sample CX-90-25 agreeing with the conclusions drawn based on the Raman spectra.

## Electrical conductivity

The correlation between the structural order and the abundance of $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$-conjugated carbon domains in CX was further assessed by comparing the electrical conductivity of the CX samples. The electrical conductivity was the highest for samples CX-90-25, CX-90-45 and CX-60-65 and reached $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ in the latter case. When the $I(D) / I(G)$ intensity ratio increases, the electrical conductivity of the sample decreases (Fig. 10 a and d, b and e, c and f $)$. The correlation between the electrical conductivity and the intensity ratio is not as straightforward as those between the carbon and oxygen percentages in the CX samples and the Raman fitting parameters, but in the case of similar overall concentration (equal $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}$ molar ratios), the same trend can be observed. This demonstrates that increasing the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration in the sol increases the disorder in CX, and the grains of the more ordered structure become less ordered. This result coincides with the conclusions that were based on the G band locations of the samples on Raman spectra fitted curves and with the findings regarding resorcinol-based carbon xerogel [22]. Compared to the electrical conductivities of pristine sol-gel-derived monolithic low-density carbon aerogel (ap-

proximately $5 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[77,78]$ ) and carbon xerogel powders from the literature $(0.05-0.3 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[22], 1.1 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}[79]$ in the composition with $10 \%$ binder), the $0.2-0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ that was realized in this study is a competitive result for the application of 5MR-FA CX as an electrode material.

The density of CX (Fig. 3) is inversely correlated with the electrical conductivity of the sample. Typically, a higher material density results in a higher electrical conductivity. [35,77,80] Regarding the electrical conductivity of sol-gel-derived 5MR-FA CX powders, a higher density is accompanied by a higher level of oxygen in CX and a higher concentration of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which is not electrically conductive. As a result, the higher the density is, the lower the electrical conductivity of the 5MR-FA CX sample. As expected, the electrical conductivity is correlated with the percentage of carbon in CX (Fig. 10).

However, sample CX-60-45 has lower electrical conductivity than anticipated based on the $I(D) / I(G)$ ratio and the carbon percentage in the sample. The higher intensity of the $D+D^{\prime}$ region and the less pronounced 2 D band in the Raman spectrum of CX-6045 (Fig. 5 b) correspond to higher disorder [56] compared to other samples from the CX series with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / 5 \mathrm{MR}=45$, which explains this behaviour. The cause of this structural difference remains unexplained, but the same molar ratios enabled us to obtain 5MR-FA carbon aerogels of the lowest density [25].

A study by Fung et al. showed that the electrical conductivity for activated carbon fibres is more sensitive to the specific surface area of the samples than the parameters of the Raman spectra [81]. The 5MR-FA CX samples enable the preparation of powders with low and reasonably high specific surface area with a wide range of electrical conductivities. Due to the gradual variability of the CX structure and the consistency of the Raman spectra, 5MR-FA CX has substantial potential as a model material for various applications.

## Conclusions

The results of this study vividly demonstrate the potential of sol-gel-derived 5MR-FA carbon xerogel due to its adjustable structure and properties. The morphology of CX can be efficiently controlled over a broad range, as demonstrated by $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sorption analysis, SEM, density measurements, XRD and elemental analysis, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, due to the direct correlations between the oxygen content in the CX structure and the density, porosity, specific surface area, electrical conductivity and degree of ordering in the carbonaceous structure, this xerogel is attractive as a model system for fundamental studies, except if the $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ concentration is too high, in which case the results deviate from the trend due to the presence of segregated needle-like $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ crystals in the CX structure. The specific surface area in the range of $2-417 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and the electrical conductivity of $0.8 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$ demonstrate the potential of the xerogel as an electrode material in electrochemical applications, such as energy storage. The level of oxidation suggests possibilities for material functionalization. Compared to 5MR-FA carbon aerogels, as expected, the corresponding CX samples are less porous, especially in terms of microporosity, but structural features such as higher density, lower specific surface area and concurrent higher structural short-range order enable broadening of the utilization of oil shale-derived 5MR to the fabrication of custom designed technological materials with added value for energy applications. With this, facile production compared to aerogels is an important advantage.
