## Role of complement activation in atherosclerosis <br> Riina Oksjoki, Petri T. Kovanen and Markku O. Penti√§inen

## Purpose of review

Atherosclerosis is characterized by a strong inflammatory component. One factor contributing to inflammation in the arterial intima is the complement system. Here we summarize recent progress in the field of complement research on atherogenesis.

## Recent findings

The complement system is activated in human atherosclerotic lesions and is actively regulated by the local synthesis of complement components and of complement regulatory proteins. Potential triggers of complement activation in the arterial intima include immunocomplexes, C-reactive protein, modified lipoproteins, apoptotic cells, and cholesterol crystals. Complement activation releases anaphylatoxins, and anaphylatoxin receptors have been identified in human atherosclerotic lesions. However, experiments on genetically engineered mice with severe hyperlipidemia have been unable to show a major role for complement in experimental atherogenesis.

## Summary

In humans there is extensive circumstantial evidence for a role of complement in atherosclerosis, which is somewhat contradictory to recent modest or negative findings in atherosclerosis-prone genetically engineered hyperlipidemic mice.

## Introduction

The complement system comprises approximately 30 components that participate in the defence against microbes, in the generation of inflammatory reactions in tissues, and in the clean-up and repair of tissues. Complement can be activated via three separate pathways: (1) the classic pathway of activation by immunoglobulins and C-reactive protein (CRP); (2) the lectin pathway of activation by bacterial mannose-binding lectin; and (3) the alternative pathway of activation by 'foreign' surfaces (Fig. 1). Knowledge of the importance of the complement system in human physiology and in disease derives from the various conditions in which complement deficiency has been observed: deficiencies in complement components that lead to impaired complement activation predispose to infections as a result of impaired opsonization and the killing of microorganisms, and to systemic lupus erythematosis and vasculitis as a result of the impaired clearance of circulating immune complexes. In contrast, enhanced complement activation caused by a deficiency of C1inhibitor leads to angioneurotic oedema, and complement activation caused by a deficiency of the complement inhibitor factor H leads to glomerulonephritis and the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.

## Historical perspective: complement deposition and activation in atherosclerotic lesions

To date, a number of studies have convincingly shown that, although no significant complement activation takes place in normal arteries, complement is extensively activated in atherosclerotic lesions and is especially strong in vulnerable and ruptured plaques. In atherosclerotic lesions, complement is activated via the classic and the alternative pathways, but there is little evidence of the activation of complement via the lectin pathway. Therefore, both immunohistochemical staining and the quantitative analysis of lesion extracts have shown the retention and activation of C1q, C4, C3, and generation of the terminal membrane attack complex C5b-9 in the lesions [1]. In addition to the infiltration of complement components from blood plasma, arterial cells express messenger RNA for complement proteins, and the expression of various complement components is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions [2]. The extent of C5b9 deposition was found to correlate with the severity of the lesion [3], and the deposits were found mainly deep in the intima associated with smooth muscle cells, cell debris and extracellular lipids [4-6]. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, the deposition of C5b-9 in the intima correlated

The complement cascade can be activated by classic and alternative pathways, which converge at the C3 level. The lectin pathway is omitted from the figure, because there is no evidence for the activation of complement via this pathway in atherosclerotic lesions. During complement activation, soluble anaphylatoxins (pink) are generated. Complement regulatory proteins are shown in red. The complement activation products that act as opsonins are coloured light violet.
temporally with cholesterol accumulation in the subendothelium, both of which occurred before monocyte infiltration and foam cell formation [7].
We recently observed that the deposition of complement iC3b, but not of C5b-9, was especially strong in ruptured and vulnerable plaques, suggesting that complement activation may be a factor in acute coronary syndromes [8.]. Once plaque rupture has taken place, components of the lesion are released into the bloodstream and may activate the complement system intravascularly [9].

## What activates complement in atherosclerotic lesions?

Immunoglobulins can activate the classic complement pathway and can also activate the alternative pathway by stabilizing C3-convertase [10]. IgM and IgG are retained in atherosclerotic lesions [11], and can form immune complexes with oxidized LDL among other lesion components [12]. Our preliminary data indicate that immunoglobulins co-localize with activated complement components, which is compatible with the idea that immune complexes may indeed activate complement in atherosclerotic lesions.
The acute-phase reactant CRP can also activate the classic complement pathway by binding C1q, but this activation may be limited to the C 3 level as a result of the binding by CRP of the complement inhibitory factor H [13]. We and others have found the deposition of CRP in human atherosclerotic lesions, and the extent of CRP deposition was shown to correlate with the severity of

C3d was deposited in the superficial intima, whereas C5b-9 was found deeper in the musculoelastic layer.
the lesion $[14,15]$. The mRNA for CRP has been shown to be present in the macrophages and smooth musclelike cells in human atherosclerotic lesions [2]. Although we and others have found co-localization of CRP and C5b-9 [14,16.*], most of the CRP in our samples appeared to co-localize with C3d and factor H, but not with C5b-9. This finding is consistent with the view that CRP is involved in opsonization, but does not lead to full-blown complement activation as a result of the binding of factor H . In addition to its role in complement regulation, CRP may affect the metabolism of LDL in atherosclerotic plaques. Although denatured CRP binds native LDL [17], CRP in its native form binds only modified LDL [18-20]. Recently, CRP has been shown to bind to Fc $\gamma$ receptors in macrophages [21], suggesting that CRP may also be involved in the uptake of modified LDL by macrophages. Importantly, another related complement-activating pentraxin, PTX3, which is secreted by stimulated endothelial cells and macrophages, has been shown to be present in atherosclerotic lesions [22]. As a result of the crossreaction of CRP antibodies with PTX3, the relative abundance of CRP and PTX3 in atherosclerotic lesions remains to be shown.

Lipids isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions have a high content of unesterified cholesterol and are able to activate the alternative complement pathway [23]. The enzymatic modification of LDL by trypsin, cholesterol esterase and neuraminidase converts LDL to particles (named E-LDL) with properties similar to those of the lipid extracted from atherosclerotic lesions, and this ELDL has the capacity to activate the complement system via the alternative pathway [24]. The binding of CRP to E-LDL enhances its complement-activating capacity [19], and E-LDL has also been detected in association with C5b-9 in early human atherosclerotic lesions [6].

Other potential complement activators present in atherosclerotic lesions include cholesterol crystals [25] and cell debris. Indeed, C5b-9 has been localized on cell debris in atherosclerotic lesions by immuno-electron microscopy [5].

## Complement regulation

When complement activation products in atherosclerotic lesions were stained, we made the unexpected observation that, in a large proportion of the lesions, C3d and C5b-9 were localized in different areas, C3d being deposited mainly in the superficial intima and $\mathrm{C5b}-9$ deeper in the musculoelastic layer (Fig. 2). We can offer two different explanations for this observation: either complement regulatory proteins are present in the superficial parts of the lesions and restrict complement activation to the C3 level, or soluble C5b9 is generated in the superficial layer, from which it diffuses to the deeper parts of the intima, where it is then deposited.

Various complement regulatory proteins have been shown to be present in atherosclerotic lesions and there is also evidence that complement regulatory proteins are actively expressed in arteries. These include the fluidphase inhibitors C1-inh, C4bp, factor H, vitronectin (protein S ) and clusterin (apolipoprotein J) and the cell membrane complement inhibitors CD55 (decay accelerating factor), CD59 (protectin) and CD46 (membrane co-factor protein-1) [26,27]. Of the inhibitors, we have provided circumstantial evidence for a role of factor H in complement inhibition. Factor H was thus associated with proteoglycans in the superficial layer of the atherosclerotic intima, and in this area C3d, but not C5b-9, was also deposited. Moreover, our in-vitro experiments showed a role for proteoglycans in complement regulation, which was probably mediated by factor H [16...]. In the light of immunohistochemical and immuno-electron microscopic data, the cell type most susceptible to attack by complement is the smooth muscle cell. This is at least partly explained by the finding that CD59 is not constitutively expressed by smooth muscle cells [28].

Whether C5b-9 is in soluble or membrane-bound form in atherosclerotic lesions has been studied extensively. During the generation of C5b-9, its precursor C5b-6 is soluble and free to diffuse, but is rapidly immobilized by binding to C 7 , which has an affinity for membranes. However, the binding of S-protein/vitronectin can solubilize C5b-7 complexes, allowing their diffusion from the site of their generation and preventing the formation of the cytolytic C5b-9 [29]. The partial colocalization of S-protein/vitronectin and C5b-9 suggests that a fraction of C5b-9 may be inactivated/solubilized by S-protein/vitronectin and that the rest of C5b-9 is likely to be in the active cytolytic form [30,31].

## Complement effectors

The complement proteins in their native form are inactive, and are converted into active species by proteolytic cleavage. Below we describe how various activated complement components interact with the immune system and with arterial cells.

## C3b and iC3b

During complement activation, C3 convertase cleaves C3 into an anaphylatoxin, C3a, and to C3b, which is rapidly metabolized into iC 3 b by factor I . The receptor for C 3 b is CR1 (CD35) and those for iC3b are CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and CR4 (CD11c/CD18). The latter two are both present at least on macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions [26,32]. C3b and iC3b are the major opsonins of the complement system, i.e. upon binding to their target structures, they participate in the recognition and phagocytosis of the target structures and also participate in the ensuing activation of the phagocyte. Among the target structures are the apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions [33]. Although CR3 mediates adhesion and phagocytosis with minimal cell activation, in the presence of appropriate costimuli, CR3-mediated phagocytosis can trigger marked cell activation [34]. With regard to atherosclerosis it is interesting to note that, when human monocyte-derived macrophages adhere to matrices containing oxidized LDL, CR3-mediated production of reactive oxygen species ensues [35].

## C5b-9 (membrane attack complex)

Activation of the terminal complement pathway leads to the assembly of $\mathrm{C} 5 \mathrm{~b}-9$, which forms a pore in the cell membrane. Accordingly, C5b-9 can cause erythrocyte lysis and, if present in large numbers, C5b-9 deposition can also lead to the lysis of nucleated cells. However, nucleated cells can escape cell lysis by exocytosing and endocytosing C5b-9. However, sublytic concentrations of C5b-9 on cell surfaces mediate signalling via various pathways [36], e.g. by inducing the influx of calcium into a cell [37]. Moreover, C5b-9 directly activates G-protein, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1, c-jun N-terminal kinase-1, nuclear factor kB and Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator transcription factor $3[1,38,39]$, which leads to the activation of various inflammatory genes and increases cdk4 and cdk2, so promoting the passage of the cell cycle through the G1 checkpoint [1]. Indeed, sublytic concentrations of C5b-9 on smooth muscle cells have been shown to induce cell proliferation and also the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [40,41]. Sublytic concentrations of C5b-9 on endothelial cells have been shown to lead to the release of basic fibroblast growth factor and plateletderived growth factor [42], to induce the expression of IL8 , monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [39], P-selectin and von Willebrand factor [43], and vascular cell adhesion molecules [44] and, in the presence of TNF- $\alpha$ also to induce the expression of E-selectin and interstitial cell adhesion molecule-1 by the affected endothelial cells [45]. Taken together, sublytic complement activation could be a significant factor contributing to smooth muscle cell proliferation and to monocyte infiltration into the arterial intima during atherogenesis.

## Anaphylatoxins

During complement activation, two anaphylatoxic peptides, C3a and C5a, are generated. For these anaphylatoxins to act on target cells, they need to bind to their specific receptors, the C3a receptor and the C5a receptor (CD88), respectively, which are both seven transmembrane domain G-coupled receptors. During complement activation, relatively large amounts of C3a are formed, which exert subtle, poorly characterized effects via the C3a receptor, whereas the much smaller amounts of C5a formed have potent and well-characterized effects via the C5a receptor. C3a is chemotactic for monocytes [46] and can trigger a respiratory burst in macrophages [47] and, moreover, it can enhance the synthesis of TNF- $\alpha$, IL-1 $\beta$ and IL-6 [48,49]. C5a, again, is chemotactic for monocytes [46], T lymphocytes [50] and mast cells [51], and may also influence the migration of inflammatory cells into the intima by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells [52]. C5a directly activates inflammatory cells, causing the release of cytokines and the secretion of lysosomal enzymes from macrophages [53,54], the proliferation of T lymphocytes [55], and the degranulation of mast cells [51]. Interestingly, the binding of C5a to C5aR in mast cells and macrophages has been shown to play a critical role in immune complex disease in the skin and lungs, respectively, apparently by controlling the expression of the Fc $\gamma$ receptors [56..,57..]. Our observations suggest that both C3aR and C5aR are expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions (P. Laine et al., unpublished data).
