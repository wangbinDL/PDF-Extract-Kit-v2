# AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE TEACHING OF CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES 

MARY G. KELTY<br>Chicago, Illinois<br>NELLE E. MOORE<br>Supervisor of Elementary Education, Wilmette, Illinois

In the period during and immediately following the World War, great interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in all types of schools. Many junior and senior high schools experimented with various methods and materials in current events and adopted definite programs, either providing special classes in the subject or working out some plan of correlation, usually with history, civics, or oral English. From time to time suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the elementary schools have occasionally been put forward, but for various reasons these suggestions have not been given serious consideration. The general feeling seems to have been that children in the upper elementary grades are too immature, their background of information too restricted, and their reading ability too limited to warrant the expectation that they might be able to understand present-day problems.

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades without the benefit of a planned program. During the first few semesters many of them gave up the attempt, declaring the available materials to be unsuited for the use of young pupils. Others have continued the study during one reading period each week, even though they did not feel fully satisfied with the results. None of them, however, so far as the writers are aware, have attempted to work out a thoroughly thought-out plan or to observe and measure results or presented evidence as to the child's understanding or interest.

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in elementary education. The results of the great improvement in silent reading ability which has come as a result of the spread of the basal reader are just beginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire field of elementary education.

school system, especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children formerly read some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of better instructional materials is being keenly felt. At the same time there has taken place in the social sciences a very genuine and widespread organization of materials, with the objective of choosing content and activities in line with social values and life-situations. Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience as possible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom. Valuable allies for such an attempt are now furnished by the news reels in the motion-picture houses and by the rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers, both of which are usually available to elementary-school children throughout the country.

Like all other students of the social sciences, the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investigate their effects on the ability of middle-grade children to read current events. Most opportunely, an invitation came to them to undertake for a period of two years, ending in June, 1931, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.

The first problem was the setting-up of an educational program. It was obvious that materials chosen for young children should be subjected to a double test: (1) accuracy and (2) suitability to children's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.

# GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 

I. [Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourthgrade work.] Most fourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.




---

2. A complete résumé of the news of the world is unsuited to the purposes and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades. Topics should be carefully selected, and only a few should be presented at one time.
3. A variety of interests should be built up-political, geographic, economic, mechanical, artistic, scientific, etc. Foreign news should receive as much attention as domestic news.
4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an important phase of world-news. It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding. A few other short articles (perhaps two to four) may deal with other selected topics.
5. When feasible, the leading articles may well alternate foreign and domestic news. They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.
6. In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly constituted a leading article.
7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appearance in a current-events paper. The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.
8. Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to current events, the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour a week.
9. Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers produced for adults, the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.
10. Children's information can be tested. Their interest in the materials, however, can best be judged by their classroom teachers.

# THE CONDUCTING OF THE EXPERIMENT 

From the outset the experiment faced a serious disadvantage in connection with the physical makeup of the paper. The fact that the sheets were only $5 \frac{1}{2}$ by 8½ inches in size necessitated the use of very small type, which seriously impaired the value of the few pictures th overtured. The results secured were attained in spite of the unattractive appearance of the paper. Teachers were helped, however, in making the reading more interesting, by a sheet on "Teaching Current Events," which was sent out at the beginning of the year.

Each weekly issue contained a leading article, from five hundred to a thousand words in length, one or two shorter articles, and an entire page devoted to tests and activities in various forms. The tests were informal objective tests of rote material based on the leading article. The "activities" suggested things to be done to maintain children's interest and to develop understanding.

All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grade classes. ${ }^{1}$ They also followed the reactions of several groups of children to the differing types of materials that were presented week by week. By the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the time was ripe for the program might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of two of the leading publishers the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children in eight states were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to administer the weekly tests, record their results on a tabulation sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. All these teachers reported for one, two, or three terms but did not continue for the entire year. These schools represented large cities, small towns, and rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations. The publishers also generously co-operated in printing and mailing the record sheets.

In addition to a tabulation of the test results, the teachers were asked to furnish the following information.

# TO BE FILLED OUT AT THE END OF NINE WEEKS 

## VOTE OF CHILDREN

I. To the Teacher: Ask the children to write the answers to these questions and, in the blanks below, fill in the names of the stories receiving the highest votes with the reason most generally given.
A. Which of the front-page stories that you have read in the paper during Numbers 1 to 9 , inclusive, do you like best? (Look back through your paper if you do not remember the names of the front-page stories.)

Name of story $\qquad$
Why did you like it best?
B. Which second best?

Name of story $\qquad$
Why did you like it?
C. Which third best?

Name of story $\qquad$
Why did you like it?
II. Ask the children to write "yes" or "no" in answer to the following question. Names need not be signed.
Does your family take a daily newspaper?
A weekly newspaper?

[^0]
[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ It was soon evident that classes in current events were unsuitable for most fourth grades.

# FOR THE TEACHER TO RECORD 

Number of families taking a daily newspaper $\square$
A weekly newspaper
Number of children in the class
In what grade are they?
III. Will the teachers please answer these questions.

1. How many pupils in your room give evidence of reading newspapers? Check the things they do which make you think they read newspapers:
a) Bring pictures to school.
b) Tell the class additional material.
2. In the time you have for reading the News-Outline does it seem to you that the quantity of material in the paper is sufficient, or should the quantity be doubled? (check)
Present quantity sufficient
Quantity should be doubled
3. In your judgment is the language used suitable for fifth-grade children? If not, which topics presented the greatest reading difficulties? (To be answered only by fifth-grade teachers)
4. Check the right statement below:

I find the page of tests and teachers' helps in the News-Outline
a) Very helpful
b) Helpful
c) Not of much help
5. If you feel that this page is not of much help, will you please tell what changes would make it more valuable to you?

## THE FINDINGS

In order that the reader may understand the type of current events material used in the study, the titles of the forty-two stories used in the News-Outline are given in Table I. The classifications into political, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the story. Thus a story may appear as political here though it might be classed differently elsewhere.

A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices of domestic and foreign news stories in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. Sixteen stories of domestic news ranked first, second, or third in the choice of these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received the same ranking. Of the thirty-two stories which were most frequently chosen, seven of the favorite stories are classified as political, five are classified as geographical, and three as economic, the remaining seventeen being marked social. The choices of these children seem to indicate that fifth and sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and domestic

and that they have greater interest in the important phases of the news than has been commonly believed by teachers and administrators.

Table III shows the types of illustrations, if any, which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories were illustrated in the St. Louis paper. Of these thirty-five, fourteen had no front-page illustration. This fact may be attached to the fact that fourteen of the thirty-five stories, whether considered as first, second, or third choices had front-page illustrations.

While this study secured no data as to the amount of space given over topictures in the paper from the point of view of size of the paper, the experimenters feel that the need for a larger middle-grade newspaper is imperative. A larger paper with liberal use of maps, pictures, and charts would, of course, cost much more than the middle-grade paper now available, and no commercial firm can be expected to put a paper on the market unless the schools can buy it.

The publication of such a paper would appear to be a field for subsidizing by a foundation interested in education.

An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of the stories through objective tests-true-false, multiple-choice, and completion of outlines. A comparison of the ratings according to the ease of reading as shown by these three methods

cording to choices shows little or no relation between choice of story and ease of reading. However, the scores of the pupils on all the other tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the stories had been comprehended by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores were consistently made on the true-false and the multiple-choice types of tests, the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were determined by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading the stories. Table IV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.
The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families took daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take daily papers and that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent take weekly papers. Teachers reported that about 50 per cent of the pupils gave evidence of reading newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting additional information to the class.

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to vocabulary difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the vocabulary suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of material in the News Outline was sufficient to serve the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.

# CONCLUSIONS 

The data seem to justify the following conclusions. (1) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can become interested in important world-news of a variety of types, including political, historical, geographical, economic, and social. (2) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can read world-news intelligently if it is presented to them with proper explanations and in language suitable for young children. (3) It seems probable that classroom use of a current-events paper introduces pupils to important phases of world-news enough to start newspaper reading outside of class and serves as a guide for such reading. (4) Attractive illustrations influence pupil choices of stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including English and social-studies material for a thirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
