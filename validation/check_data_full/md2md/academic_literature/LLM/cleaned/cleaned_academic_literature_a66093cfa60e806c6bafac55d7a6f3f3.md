## Abstract

The role of membrane pore size and solution chemistry in ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling by colloidal natural organic matter (NOM) has been investigated. Fouling experiments were conducted with two laboratory-made cellulose acetate UF membranes, with estimated pore sizes of 2 and 10 nm , under identical hydrodynamic conditions. Flux decline with colloidal NOM was independent of pH and increased in the presence of calcium. The membrane pore size has been found to influence membrane flux decline. Permeate flux for the more permeable membrane ( 10 nm pore size) decreased faster than the flux of the tightest, less permeable membrane ( 2 nm pore size). The adhesion forces between the foulant (colloidal NOM) and the clean membrane, and between the foulant in bulk solution and foulant in the fouling layer, were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Force measurements confirmed the fouling trends with calcium ions. For a given solution chemistry, foulant-foulant adhesion was identical for both membranes, indicating that the more pronounced flux decline observed for the largest pore-size membrane was not related to differences in intermolecular chemical interactions among NOM molecules. At the earlier stage of filtration, the dominant fouling mechanism was pore blocking for both membranes. For longer filtration times, there was a transition in the fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake formation. This transition occurred first for the more permeable membrane, indicating that colloidal NOM penetrates more readily into the pores of this membrane and that the relative size of colloidal NOM and the membrane pore influences the rate of pore blocking. The results further suggest that the structure of the fouling layer is dependent on the operating pressure. At high pressure, the compactness and specific resistance of the colloidal NOM layer substantially increase, and thus, significantly affect the extent of flux decline.

## 1. Introduction

Ultrafiltration is widely used in drinking water and wastewater treatment [1,2]. Membrane fouling is a major obstacle to the UF efficiency and results in reduction of membrane performance. Among the many potential foulants in natural water, natural organic matter (NOM) is the most recalcitrant. Despite the vast efforts to reduce membrane fouling by improving membrane properties, optimizing operational conditions, and pretreatment of the feed water, fouling is inevitable. Therefore, understanding fouling phenomena is critical for the development of membrane-based water treatment technologies.

Membrane fouling is influenced by the filtration mode (crossflow or dead-end filtration) [3], and by the hydrodynamic conditions, like crossflow velocity and applied pressure that governs the permeate flux and the convective transport of foulants towards the membrane [4,14]. Moreover, studies confirmed that membrane fouling by NOM is influenced by the NOM characteristics (aromaticity, charge, and molecular configuration) [5,6]. The colloidal fraction of NOM was found to be a major fouling component in ultrafiltration of NOM solutions [7,8], and similarly, small organic colloids, with sizes ranging from 3 to 20 nm , were found to be major foulants for UF when processing natural surface water [9]. Membrane fouling is also dependent on the membrane characteristics (pore size, charge, and roughness) [10-13], and on the feed water chemistry (pH, ionic strength, and divalent cation concentration) [4,7,14-16]. The pH and ionic composition of feed water influence the chemical interactions between the foulant (NOM) and the membrane and between the foulant and the fouling layer [14]. The presence of divalent cations, most notably $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, has a marked effect on NOM fouling, because they react with organic molecules and form $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{NOM}$

complexes, which results in a highly compacted fouling layer and thus leads to significant flux decline [4,7,17,18].

Membrane properties of microporous membranes, such as UF and microfiltration (MF), also play an important role in fouling. Studies performed with MF and UF membranes in dead-end and crossflow modes reported that NOM fouling was greatest for membranes with larger pore size [10,13,19,20]. Costa and de Pinho [19] carried out crossflow UF with colloidal NOM solutions using several membranes with different pore sizes and observed that the tighter membranes did not exhibit flux decline under the operating pressures used. In contrast, for the same operating pressures, the more permeable membranes displayed a pronounced flux decline. Because the more permeable membranes in the above study experienced higher permeate fluxes than the tighter membranes, the fouling behavior is likely related to the higher convective transport and deposition of foulants on the membrane surface. It is to be noted, however, that comparing the fouling of two membranes with different permeabilities based on solely the permeate flux behavior poses some difficulties. For the same amount of foulant accumulation, and the same operating pressure, the membrane with the lower intrinsic resistance (or higher permeability) will display a greater flux decline rate.

Flux decline caused by organic matter fouling may result from concentration polarization, pore blocking, and from the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface [21,22]. The membrane pore size relative to the size distribution of the foulants in the feed solution is a key factor governing the membrane fouling mechanisms. Foulants smaller than the membrane pores can adsorb onto the pore walls and lead to pore constriction. Larger foulants can block pore entrances and lead to a sharp flux decline.

A few studies examining the fouling mechanisms during microfiltration of protein solutions in dead end stirred cells showed that after pore blocking is complete, fouling shifts to cake formation [23,24]. Yuan and Zydney [25] developed a combined pore blocking-cake filtration model to describe humic acid fouling during microfiltration in dead end mode. Their results demonstrated that the initial fouling rate is attributed to pore blocking caused by deposition of large aggregates on the surface of the membrane. After pore blocking, a humic deposit started to form in the regions of the membrane that were covered by the humic aggregates. More recently, Taniguchi et al. [21] reported NOM fouling of UF membranes in crossflow mode. It was shown that cake formation was the dominant fouling mechanism; however, for membranes with larger pores, pretreatment of feed solution for the removal of NOM aggregates prevented cake formation and shifted the mode of fouling to pore blocking.

The objective of this paper is to systematically study the influence of UF membrane pore size on the mechanisms that govern membrane fouling by colloidal natural organic matter under various solution chemistries (pH and the presence of calcium). The performance of a tight cellulose acetate UF membrane is compared to that of a very permeable cellulose acetate UF membrane under identical initial permeate fluxes. Under these conditions, the initial convective transport of foulants toward the membrane surface is similar for both membranes, which allows a more meaningful comparison of the physicochemical fouling mechanisms involved.

# 2. Materials and methods 

### 2.1. Colloidal organic matter

Commercial humic acid (Aldrich Chemicals) was chosen as a model for colloidal NOM and was purified to remove iron and decrease the ash content. The purification was performed in two steps, as described earlier by Costa and de Pinho [19]: precipitation with hydrochloric acid followed by ultrafiltration in diafiltration mode. A commercial membrane (ETNA10PP, DSS, Denmark) with a reported MWCO of 10 kDa was used. This membrane exhibits very high rejection of NOM but allows the passage of salts added during the precipitation step. After this operation, ultrafiltration is run in a concentration mode to concentrate the colloidal NOM solution. The resulting concentrated colloidal NOM is further concentrated in a vacuum evaporator and dried at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to obtain a solid substance.

All humic acid model solutions were prepared with deionized water. ACS grade HCl, NaOH, NaCl, and $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ were used to adjust the pH, the ionic strength, and the calcium content of the solutions.

The size and morphology of the colloidal organic matter were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). One drop of the colloidal NOM solution was deposited on a Formvar carbon-coated nickel grid and the excess solution was removed with a filter paper. A staining solution of $2 \%$ uranyl acetate was used to increase the contrast of the samples for TEM observation. The staining solution was deposited on the grid, where the drop of NOM solution was previously deposited, and the grid was placed on a filter paper to adsorb the excess staining agent. The grid was air dried and examined in a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope at 100 kV. Images were recorded digitally using a Gatan camera.

### 2.2. Membrane preparation and characterization

Two cellulose acetate asymmetric membranes were synthesized in the laboratory according to the phase inversion method described by Kunst and Sourirajan [26]. The cellulose acetate ( $38.9 \%$ acetyl content) was supplied by Eastman-Kodak. Table 1 displays the casting solution composition and the film casting conditions for the membranes, designated CA1 and CA5, with increasing content of formamide to yield a more permeable membrane.

The membranes were characterized in terms of pure water hydraulic permeability $\left(L_{p}\right)$ and molecular weight cut-off (MWCO). Details on characterization of these membranes are given in Costa and de Pinho [19]. In order to determine the MWCO, permeation experiments with neutral reference macromolecules were performed. The solutes were polyethylenglycols (PEG) of $600,1000,3000,6000$, and 10000 Da (supplied by Merck), and dextrans T-10, T-40, T-70, and T-110 (supplied by Pharmacia). The MWCO is determined by the intersection of the curve of $\log (f /(1-f))$ versus solute molecular weight

with the 91\% rejection line that corresponds to a value of $\log$ $(f /(1-f))$ of 1 . Here, $f$ is the reference solute rejection defined as $f=\left(C_{f}-C_{P}\right) / C_{f}$, where $C_{f}$ and $C_{P}$ are the feed and the permeate concentrations, respectively. The solute rejection is calculated in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) content.

# 2.3. Fouling experiments 

Fouling experiments were performed in a dead-end filtration system. The filtration unit comprises a 250 mL stainless steel stirred cell with a membrane area of $33.2 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Pressure was provided by a compressed $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ tank. The permeate was collected and the mass was monitored continuously during the experiments by an analytical balance connected to a computer. Permeate flux was calculated from the change in the cumulative mass of permeate water as a function of time.

The fouling runs were carried out with the model NOM solutions in the absence and in the presence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The colloidal NOM solutions contained $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of humic acid and up to $1 \mathrm{~mM}$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The total ionic strength was adjusted to 10 mM with NaCl and the pH was fixed at 4.2 or 8.2 . For determination of the membrane fouling mechanisms by colloidal NOM, it is required to accelerate fouling in order to obtain a well defined curve of permeate flux versus time. For these accelerated runs, fouling was carried out with solutions containing 1000 mg/L colloidal NOM in the presence of $1.0 \mathrm{~mM} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The protocol for the fouling experiments with the CA1 and CA5 membrane consisted of compaction, conditioning, and fouling. The CA1 and CA5 membranes were compacted at pressures of 36 bar (520 psi) and 1.4 bar ( 20 psi), respectively, until the permeate flux stabilized. Next, the pure water flux was measured at pressures of $21,28$, and 35 bar for the CA1 membrane, and at pressures of $1.4,2.1$, and 2.8 bar for the CA5 membrane. Then, the stirred cell was filled with deionized water and the pressure was adjusted to reach the desired initial permeate flux of $30 \mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ (or $108 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$ ), and a baseline for 30 min was established. The initial permeate flux was kept constant at $30 \pm 2 \mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ in all the experiments. After this stage, the stirred cell was filled with the colloidal NOM solution that was filtered at a fixed pressure and at a stirring rate of 500 rpm . Fouling continued until the cumulative volume of permeate flux reached 200 mL. All permeation experiments were carried out at room temperature $(22^{\circ} \mathrm{C})$.

A mass balance quantified the deposited mass of colloidal NOM $\left(m_{d}\right)$ on the fouled membrane surface at the end of the run:

$$
C_{f} V_{f}=C_{c} V_{c}+C_{p} V_{p}+m_{d}
$$

where $V_{f}$ and $V_{c}$ are the volumes of stirred-cell solution at the beginning and at the end of the run, respectively, $V_{p}$ the cumulative permeate volume, $C_{f}$ and $C_{c}$ the concentrations of the stirred-cell solution at the beginning and at the end of the fouling run, respectively, and $C_{p}$ is the concentration in the collected permeate. These NOM concentrations were determined in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) using a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCSH).

### 2.4. Membrane cleaning

Membrane cleaning was carried out through the sequential addition of batches of 250 mL cleaning solutions at a stirring rate of 1000 rpm for 15 min for each batch. In the first batch, the cleaning agent was deionized water. This cleaning was followed by an alkaline cleaning with NaOH solution at pH 9.5. Next, the filtration unit was rinsed with deionized water to remove the residual cleaning solution. The permeate flux was measured at 21,28 , and 35 bar for the CA1 membrane, and at $1.4,2.1$, and 2.8 bar for CA5 membrane. These fluxes were compared with those measured before the fouling runs and the cleaning efficiency was assessed. The cleaning efficiency was calculated as the ratio between the pure water flux after cleaning and the pure water flux of the clean membrane before the fouling experiments.

### 2.5. Interfacial force measurements

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the interfacial forces between the foulant in bulk solution and the membrane and between the foulant in the fouling layer and the foulant in bulk solution. The force measurements were performed with a colloid probe attached to a tipless cantilever. Because carboxylic groups are the predominant functional groups of humic acid, a carboxylate modified latex (CML) particle (Interfacial Dynamics Corp.), 4.1 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter, was used as a surrogate for NOM. This procedure was described by Li and Elimelech [17].

The force measurements were performed in a fluid cell with a close input/output loop. The test solution used in the force measurements that mimic membrane-foulant interaction was 10 mM NaCl. For the measurement of foulant-foulant interactions, a 10 mg/L colloidal NOM solution in the presence ( 0.3 mM ) or in the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ at a fixed total ionic strength of 10 mM was used. The concentration of colloidal NOM is lower than for the solutions used during the fouling runs. This is due to the fact that, for high NOM concentration, there is a high concentration of aggregates that significantly interfere with the force measurements. Before injection of each solution, the fluid cell was rinsed with a 10 mM NaCl solution and then with the test solution. After injection, the membrane was equilibrated with the test solution for 30 min before the force measurements. Due to inher-

ent local surface heterogeneities of the membranes, the force measurements were conducted at three different locations on a $1 \mu \mathrm{m} \times 1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ membrane area. Ten measurements were taken in each location. Averaged AFM raw data were used to produce a force versus separation distance curve. The raw data, namely the curves of cantilever deflection versus displacement, were converted to force versus surface-to-surface distance curves using the method reported by Ducker et al. [27].

# 3. Results and discussion 

### 3.1. Colloidal NOM properties

Fig. 1 presents a TEM image of the model colloidal NOM solution. This image shows that the humic acid used comprises aggregates of varying morphology and size (from a few nanometers up to hundreds of nanometers). This observation is in accord with our previous study using the same colloidal NOM source [19]. In that study, we observed that rejection of NOM was practically complete for a UF membrane having a 2 nm pore size and over $90 \%$ for a more permeable UF membrane ( 10 nm pore size). These results were obtained in the early stage of filtration, in the absence of a fouling layer that can increase the colloidal NOM rejection, and indicate that the major fraction of colloidal NOM has a larger size than the membranes pores. The colloidal NOM, like other humic substances, contains aromatic and aliphatic components with carboxylic and phenolic functional groups, and thus, is negatively charged in the examined pH range [28].

### 3.2. Membrane characterization

Table 2 shows the hydraulic permeability $\left(L_{p}\right)$, the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), and the pore sizes of the CA1 and CA5 membranes. The mean pore diameter of the membranes was calculated as described in [19] through an algorithm that incorporates the pore flow model [29,30].

### 3.3. Influence of calcium ions on colloidal NOM fouling

Recent studies have demonstrated that calcium ions play a very important role in NOM fouling of UF and NF membranes [4,7,17,18]. This fouling behavior is attributed to the complexation of calcium ions with the NOM acidic functional groups, forming a compact crossliked NOM fouling layer that provides a significant additional resistance to permeate water flow.

Figs. 2 and 3 show the effect of calcium on colloidal NOM fouling of the CA1 and CA5 membranes, respectively, at both pH 4.2 and 8.2. In order to evaluate the effect of calcium and solution pH on fouling behavior, the same hydrodynamic conditions (initial permeate flow and stirring rate) were used for both membranes. The results in Fig. 2(b) show that for the lowest, 0.3 mM calcium concentration, the permeate fluxes are identical to those observed in the absence of calcium. However, when calcium concentration increases to 1.0 mM, the permeate fluxes decrease

drastically for both pH values. This will be further discussed in Section 3.5 when presenting the corresponding interfacial force measurements.

From Fig. 2, one can notice that for the tightest CA1 membrane, the permeate flux decline behaviors are comparable at both pH values for identical solution compositions. This behavior is also observed in Fig. 3 by the more permeable CA5 membrane, thus confirming pH did not influence fouling by colloidal NOM. However, there are NOM fouling studies [4,14,15] that reported more pronounced flux decline at low pH and attributed it to the reduction in the NOM macromolecule charge. This charge reduction decreases the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and NOM and between NOM in solution and deposited NOM, thus increasing the overall NOM deposition rate on the membrane surface. In the present work, however, colloidal NOM is used, and the fact that fouling was similar for both pH values indicates that at the pH range of 4.2-8.2, the characteristics of NOM colloids should be comparable and thus the membrane-foulant and foulant-foulant interactions are similar.

# 3.4. Comparison of the performance of the UF membranes 

Several studies implied that fouling of UF membranes is greatest for larger pore-size membranes [10,13,19,20]. However, in these studies, the operating pressure was the same for all the membranes, such that hydrodynamic conditions (initial permeate flux) were not identical. Therefore, for the more permeable membranes, there was more convective transport of foulants towards the membrane surface that induced more pronounced fouling.

In this work, the effect of membrane pore size on fouling was evaluated under identical initial permeate fluxes. Fig. 4 compares the permeate flux behaviors of the tight (CA1) and the very permeable (CA5) UF membranes at $\mathrm{pH} 4.2$ and 8.2. It is observed that at both pH values and in the absence of calcium, the more permeable CA5 membrane exhibits faster flux decline than the tightest membrane. This behavior is also observed in the presence of calcium ions. These results point out that the relative size of the NOM colloidal foulants and the membrane pores is playing a role in membrane fouling. This finding will be discussed in Section 3.6 .

Costa and de Pinho [19] performed crossflow ultrafiltration of $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ colloidal NOM solution with the same membranes at pressures ranging from 1 to 4 bar and reported that, under these conditions, the CA1 membrane did not exhibit flux decline. In that study, however, the NOM feed solution concentration and the initial permeate flux were much lower than those used in the current work, and thus, the initial permeate flux was below the critical flux, the flux below which fouling does not occur $[31]$.

The following conditions were maintained during the fouling experiments: colloidal NOM concentration of $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$, total ionic strength of 10 mM , operating pressures of 3.5 bar (CA1) and 1.4 bar (CA5), stirring rate of 500 rpm, and temperature of $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

# 3.5. Interfacial force measurements 

Membrane fouling can be caused by foulant deposition on the membrane surface or within the membrane pores. Therefore, fouling is governed by the interactions between the foulant and the clean membrane at the very initial stage of fouling, and, most importantly, by the interactions between the foulant in bulk solution and the foulant in the fouling layer at later stages. Interfacial force measurements using an AFM colloidal probe allow the assessment of these interactions.

The energy per unit area required to separate a particle from a flat surface by an infinite distance is proportional to the adhesion force, $F[17]$ :

$$
F=2 \pi R W(\infty)
$$

where $R$ is the radius of the spherical particle and $W(\infty)$ is the energy per unit area required to separate the particle and the flat surface by an infinite distance. The adhesion force can be considered as a measure of the energy required to prevent a foulant from accumulating on the membrane surface. In this work, $F$ is normalized by the radius of the particle, $R$, to allow the comparison of forces measured with AFM colloid probes of different sizes. If the particle probe experiences adhesion with the surface, the value of $F / R$ is negative.

The force measurements were first carried out for the clean membranes in the absence of NOM. Under these conditions, the interfacial forces between the CML colloid probe and the clean membrane surface correspond to the interaction between the foulant in the bulk solution and the clean membrane and are indicative of the initial fouling rate. The interaction forces between the CML particle and the foulants on the membrane surface were also measured for both membranes in the presence and in the absence of calcium ions at pH 4.2 and 8.2. The colloidal NOM solution was injected into the fluid cell and equilibrated for 30 min. This allows a layer of colloidal NOM to adsorb on the membrane surface as well as on the CML particle probe. Hence, the interaction between the foulant layer and the CML particle represents foulant-foulant interaction.

Fig. 5 presents the retracting (pull-off) force curves obtained for the CML colloid probe and the CA1 and CA5 membranes at $p H 4.2$ and 8.2. The CML particle experienced different levels of adhesion when it was retracted away from the membrane surface after being in contact with the membrane surface. The CML particle did not display adhesion force in the absence of colloidal NOM, indicating that there is no membrane-foulant adhesion. This is in contrast with the force measurements carried out for both membranes in the presence of colloidal NOM where there is adhesion of the CML probe to the fouled mem-

brane surface. This behavior was not expected because, under the conditions of the experiments, the membranes are covered by a foulant layer of colloidal NOM that is negatively charged and, as a result, the fouled membrane and the CML particle should experience strong electrostatic repulsion. Thus, the adhesion observed between the CML probe and the fouling layer may suggest that during the NOM purification process, metal ions that were in the commercial NOM were not completely removed, thus decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the CML probe and the NOM deposited layer. The magnitude of the adhesion is practically the same for both membranes for the two different pH values tested $(-0.2 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{mN} / \mathrm{m})$. This is consistent with the permeate flux data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 that show similar permeate flux decline curves for both membranes at both pH values.

In the presence of calcium ions, the adhesion force between the CML colloidal probe and the NOM fouling layer increases for both membranes. This was also observed by Li and Elimelech [17] in their force measurements related to NF membrane fouling by humic acid. The results were attributed to the association of $\mathrm{COO}^{-}$functional groups in the NOM fouling layer with those on the CML probe via calcium bridging.

Despite the increase in foulant-foulant adhesion in the presence of calcium, the fouling experiments show that there was no increase in flux decline at 0.3 mM calcium concentration (Figs. 2 and 3). In the presence of $0.3 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, it was expected that the formation of intermolecular bridges among NOM foulants would favor fouling and induce a significant flux decline. It is likely that the shear rate due to stirring mitigated fouling and thus overcame the favorable impact of calcium on fouling. Thus, for the given experimental conditions (initial permeate flux and stirring rate), there is not a remarkable flux decline compared to the experiments performed in the absence of calcium. This is in accordance with SchÃ¤fer et al. [7] reporting that, at a given stirring rate, the rate of flux decline increased only when the calcium concentration was above a critical value.

When the calcium concentration is increased to 1.0 mM, the amount of calcium-NOM complexes formed is higher and the formation of intermolecular bridges among NOM foulants occurs to a greater extent, thus enhancing NOM deposition and leading to the formation of a more compact fouling layer. This is in agreement with previous findings [4,18] indicating that membrane fouling rate is determined by the coupled influence of chemical and hydrodynamic interactions.

The interfacial force measurements indicate that membranefoulant and foulant-foulant interactions are similar for both membranes. Thus, the more pronounced flux decline observed for the more permeable CA5 membrane may not be related to chemical factors that influence fouling. Other physical interactions need to be invoked to explain the difference in the fouling behaviors of the CA1 and CA5 membranes.

# 3.6. Determination of membrane fouling mechanisms by colloidal NOM 

In order to determine the membrane fouling mechanisms by colloidal NOM, it is imperative to have well defined curves of permeate flux versus time. To obtain such curves, accelerated fouling tests were carried out with the CA1 and CA5 membranes. The conditions to induce accelerated fouling were the use of a solution containing 1000 mg/L colloidal NOM, $1.0 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and a total ionic strength of 10 mM.

Fig. 6 compares the accelerated permeate flux declines of the CA1 and CA5 membranes. The permeate flux decreases faster for the more permeable membrane and both membranes reach a plateau at about the same permeate flux ( $5 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}$ ).

Fouling modes relevant to the dead-end filtration experiments can be analyzed based on the approach described by Hermanns and BredÃ©e and by Hermia [32,33]. Three fouling mechanisms are described: pore blocking, pore constriction, and cake formation. Pore blocking can be complete or intermediate. The pore blocking is complete when each foulant arriving at the membrane blocks the pores. In the intermediate pore blocking mechanism, foulants deposit on other already deposited foulant particles or directly block some membrane area. In pore constriction mechanism or standard blocking, foulants smaller than the membrane pores adsorb to the internal pore walls. In cake formation mechanism, foulants deposit on other already deposited foulants and cake layer starts to form.

These three classical fouling models are described by the following generalized equation [33]:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} t}{\mathrm{~d} V^{2}}=k\left(\frac{\mathrm{d} t}{\mathrm{~d} V}\right)^{n}
$$

where $t$ is the filtration time and $V$ is the total filtered volume. The exponent $n$ is the filtration number and characterizes the filtration fouling mechanism. The value of $n$ is 0 when the fouling mechanism is cake formation. For complete pore blocking, pore constriction, and intermediate blocking, $n$ takes the values of 2 , $3 / 2$, and 1 , respectively.

The experimental data of permeate flux versus time were further analyzed in order to generate plots of $\mathrm{d}^{2} t / \mathrm{d} V^{2}$ versus $\mathrm{d} t / \mathrm{d} V$ as suggested by Eq. (3). These derivatives can be presented

Fig. 6. Comparison of the permeate flux decline of the CA1 and CA5 membranes. Experimental conditions were as follows: colloidal NOM concentration of 1000 mg/L, $1.0 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, total ionic strength of 10 mM, pH 8.2, operating pressure of 35 bar for the CA1 membranes, operating pressure of 1.4 bar for the CA5 membranes, temperature of $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and stirring rate of 500 rpm.

Here $d J / d t$ is evaluated by differentiating the adjusted polynomials that best fit the experimental data of flux versus time.

Fig. 7 presents the flux decline analysis for colloidal NOM during ultrafiltration for both the CA1 and CA5 membranes. For low values of $d t / d V$, which correspond to short filtration times, the data for both membranes yield a linear relationship with a filtration number of 2 . This is in excellent agreement with the behavior predicted by the pore blocking model. For the CA1 membrane, at higher values of $d t / d V$ that correspond to longer filtration times, the curve reaches a maximum and tends to a plateau. This means that $d^{2} t / d V^{2}$ is practically constant, and in this case Eq. (3) has a filtration number of 0 when fitting the data of $d^{2} t / d V^{2}$ versus $d t / d V$. Thus, for the CA1 membrane, the fouling mechanism for longer filtration times is cake formation. However, for the more permeable CA5 membrane, the $d^{2} t / d V^{2}$ versus $d t / d V$ curve also tends to a plateau, but the transition in the mode of fouling to cake formation is not fully achieved.

The peak of the curves in Fig. 7 corresponds to the transition in the fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake filtration. For the CA1 membrane, this transition occurs for values of $d V / d t$ that correspond to a filtration time of 16 min (or 65 ml cumulative volume) while for the CA5 membrane this peak corresponds to 6 min (or 25.2 ml cumulative volume). These results clearly show that the transition in fouling mode occurs earlier for the more permeable membrane. At the early stage of ultrafiltration, pore blocking is the predominant fouling mechanism for both membranes. This phenomenon occurs faster for the more permeable membrane and leads to a more pronounced flux decline at the early stage of filtration.

# 3.7. Membrane cleaning 

After the fouling experiments with $1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ colloidal NOM and $1.0 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the membranes were cleaned with deionized water and a sodium hydroxide solution at pH 9.5. Fig. 8 summarizes the cleaning efficiency in terms of pure water flux recovery. The flux recovery after deionized water cleaning is very low (about $20 \%$ ) for both membranes. However, the more permeable membrane exhibited complete flux recovery upon basic solution cleaning, indicating that all the foulants are removed. The cleaning was carried out with no pressure applied and with no permeation through the membrane pores; therefore, only the foulants at the membrane surface can be removed. The results suggest that, for the CA5 membrane, pore blocking occurs at the pore entrance, and thus, foulants that are blocking the pores are easily removed during the basic solution cleaning. This is in contrast with the results obtained with the tightest CA1 membrane, which is much more difficult to clean and does not show flux recovery higher than $50 \%$, even after basic solution cleaning at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Fig. 9 presents snapshots of the CA1 and CA5 membranes taken after the basic solution cleaning. The photographs show that the CA1 membrane is still covered by a thick layer of the organic foulant. The differences in the cleaning efficiency observed for the UF membranes clearly show that the characteristics of the fouling layer of each membrane are different as will be discussed in the following section.

# 3.8. Fouling layer characteristics 

The mass of the colloidal NOM deposited on the membranes at the end of the accelerated fouling runs ( 1000 mg/L colloidal NOM and $1.0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) and the specific cake resistance $(\alpha)$ of the fouling layer are presented in Table 3. The specific cake resistance $(\alpha)$ of the fouling layer is defined as [22]:

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{c}}{A_{m} m_{\text {dep }}}
$$

where $A_{m}$ is the membrane surface area, $m_{\text {dep }}$ the mass of colloidal NOM deposited on the membrane surface, and $R_{c}$ is the hydraulic resistance of the cake layer. The latter was determined from

$$
R_{c}=R_{t}-R_{m}
$$

where $R_{t}$ is the total resistance determined from the permeate flux at the end of the fouling run (corresponding to flux $J_{p}$ ). It is given by $R_{t}=\Delta P /\left(J_{p} \mu\right)$ with $\Delta P$ being the operating pressure and $\mu$ the solution viscosity. The membrane resistance $R_{m}$ is given by $R_{m}=\Delta P /\left(J_{p w} \mu\right)$, where $J_{p w}$ is the pure water flux at the operating pressure of the fouling runs.
The results show that the mass deposited on the surface of the tightest membrane (CA1) is lower than the mass deposited on the more permeable membrane. Despite the fact that the deposited mass is lower for the tightest membrane, its specific cake resistance $\alpha$ is much higher than for the more permeable membrane (CA5). This corroborates our suggestion that the structure of the fouling layers of the membranes is different. In fact, the operating pressure for the fouling run performed with the CA 1 membrane was 36 bar , much higher than the pressure of the fouling run carried out with the CA5 membrane (1.4 bar). The very high pressure used during the fouling experiments with the CA1 membrane leads to the formation of a very compact fouling layer of colloidal NOM. This compact layer is also more difficult to clean as shown earlier in the paper. From these results, one can conclude that apart from the amount of foulant deposited at the membrane surface, the structure of the fouling layer also contributes to the extent of fouling. Moreover, the compactness of the fouling layer is clearly influenced by the operating hydraulic pressure.


## 4. Conclusion

At the early stages of filtration, the more permeable UF membrane displayed slightly faster flux decline than the tightest membrane when operating under the same initial permeate flux. This points to the importance of UF membrane pore size during colloidal NOM fouling. For both membranes, pore blocking is the dominant fouling mechanism at the initial stage of ultraï¬ltration. For longer filtration times, there is a transition in the fouling mechanism from pore blocking to cake formation. This transition occurs first for the more permeable membrane, thus indicating that colloidal NOM blocks the pores of this membrane faster. For this membrane, the cake formation mechanism is never fully achieved under the experimental conditions investigated.

In addition, the structure of the fouling layer on the membrane surface is dependent on the operating conditions, namely the applied hydraulic pressure. High pressure leads to the formation of a very compact cake layer of colloidal NOM. Thus, although the deposited mass on the tightest membrane is lower than that on the more permeable membrane, the flux decline experienced by the tight membrane is significant because of the higher specific resistance of the colloidal NOM cake formed on the membrane.

The solution chemistry, more specifically the presence of calcium ions, drastically increases membrane fouling by NOM. The adhesion force between foulants in bulk solution and foulants deposited on the fouling layer has the same magnitude for both membranes and increases in similar fashion in the presence of calcium. For a given NOM solution composition, foulant-foulant interactions are identical for the two UF membranes investigated. Therefore, the more pronounced flux decline exhibited by the more permeable membrane relative to the tight membrane is not related to differences in chemical factors. Rather, fouling is dependent on the relative sizes of the colloidal NOM foulant and membrane pores that influence
