Abstract: Fields with frequencies below megahertz are challenging for Rydberg-atom-based measurements, due to the lowfrequency electric field screening effect that is caused by the alkali-metal atoms adsorbed on the inner surface of the container. In this paper, we investigate on electric fields measurements in the ULF, VLF and LF bands in a Cs vapor cell with built-in parallel electrodes. With optimization of the applied DC field, we achieve high-sensitive detection of the electric field at frequencies of 1 kHz , 10 kHz and 100 kHz based on Rydberg-atom sensor, with the minimum electric field strength down to $18.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}, 6.9 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$ and $3.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$, respectively. The corresponding sensitivity is $5.7 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}, 2.2 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ and $0.95 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for ULF, VLF and LF fields, which is better than 1-cm dipole antenna. Besides, the linear dynamic range of Rydberg-atom sensor is over 50 dB . This work presents the potential to enable more applications that utilize atomic sensing technology in ULF, VLF and LF fields.

## 1. Introduction

Rydberg atoms with high polarizability and electric dipole moments, are sensitive to external electric field [1]. Significant progresses on Rydberg-atom sensor have been made to achieve an ultra-high sensitivity down to $55 \mathrm{nV} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ [2] and expand the operating frequency ranged from DC to THz [3-6]. Based on Autler Townes splitting or Stark shift of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy [7,8], Rydberg-atom sensor have explored the strength, frequency, phase, polarization, arrival angle and subwavelength imaging of electric fields [9-11].

Most experiments are focused on the measurement of microwave with frequency ranged from 300 MHz to 300 GHz . Recently, the study on measuring field with frequency below gigahertz based on the Stark effect of Rydberg atoms has started. The highest sensitivities of MHz fields are demonstrated as $0.96 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by heterodyne techniques [12-14]. The sensitivity of Rydberg-atom sensor for the electric fields with frequency below kilohertz is estimated to $3.4 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by spectral noise [15], and a sensitivity of $67.9 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is achieved for 100 Hz field [16], which exceeds that of a conventional antenna of the same size.

However, high-sensitive measurement of the kHz fields based on Rydberg-atom sensor is less studied before. The fields in the Ultra Low Frequency (ULF, 0.3 kHz-3 kHz), Very Low Frequency (VLF, 3 kHz-30 kHz), and Low Frequency (LF, 30 kHz-300 kHz) bands have significant applications in fields of remote timing, auxiliary navigation as well as radio communication, due to its long propagation distances and strong penetrability of these fields. The conventional receiver for low-frequency electric field usually needs a large antenna with length in meters to improve its sensitivity, which limits its further application. In contrast, Rydberg-atom sensors have a compact size in centimeters. Therefore, it makes sense to develop a high-sensitivity Rydberg-atom sensors to measure kHz electric fields.

Because of the shielding effect of the alkali-metal-atom container on low-frequency electric fields, the fields oscillating at frequencies below megahertz can hardly be detected. By adding parallel electrodes located inside an atomic vapor cell, it is possible to conduct measurements of the electric field at kHz frequency in this study. By

optimizing an auxiliary DC field, we successfully detect electric fields with strengths down to $18.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}, 6.9 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$, and $3.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$ for the $1 \mathrm{kHz}, 10 \mathrm{kHz}$ and 100 kHz signal fields, respectively. Notably, our Rydberg-atom sensor achieves the corresponding sensitivities of $5.7 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}, 2.2 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ and $0.95 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, and exhibits an impressive linear dynamic range of over 50 dB at kHz frequencies. This advancement shows the potential for enabling a broadened applications in the ULF, VLF, and LF electric fields with Rydberg-atom sensor.

## 3. Results and discussion

presented in Fig. 2, the green curve displays the field-free EIT spectrum by scanning the coupling laser, used for a reference EIT. When loaded with 100kHz signal field, distinct modulations emerge in the Rydberg EIT spectrum in the red curve of Fig. 2, as the transparency of

$^{133} \mathrm{Cs}$ atoms is modulated by electromagnetic fields. When loaded with a stronger DC field, the EIT spectrum exhibits splitting to three components (in the blue curve of Fig. 2), which reflects the breaking of degeneracy among fine structures of Rydberg state $63 D_{5 / 2}$. This can be explained by the Stark shift of the magnetic substates as

$$
\Delta f=-\alpha \frac{E^{2}}{2}
$$

herein $\alpha$ is the polarizability and $E$ is the strength of electric field. Calculated by Alkali Rydberg Calculator (ARC) [17], the polarizability of magnetic substates $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{J}}=1 / 2,3 / 2,5 / 2$ of Rydberg state $63 D_{5 / 2}$ are different as $-7312 \mathrm{MHz} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{V}^{2},-5165 \mathrm{MHz} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{V}^{2}, 431 \mathrm{MHz} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{V}^{2}$, respectively, which leads to their different Stark shift and then splitting to three spectral lines. When the 100 kHz signal field and DC field are both loaded into the Rydberg-atom sensor, the modulations in the pink curve of Fig. 2 becomes more apparent and long-lasting than that only with 100 kHz signal field. The two insets of fig. 2 clearly display that the modulations of Rydberg EIT spectra are in respond to the signal field, which are oscillates at the same frequency as 100 kHz . Furthermore, the response intensity to the 100 kHz signal field is stronger when it is accompanied by a DC field compared to when the DC field is absent. When a kHz signal field is added to the electrodes together with the DC field, the total field can be expressed as

$$
\varepsilon(t)=E_{d}+E_{k} e^{i\left(\omega_{k} t+\varphi_{k}\right)}
$$

herein $E_{k}, \omega_{k}, \varphi_{k}$ is, respectively, the strength, frequency and phase of the kHz signal field, $E_{d}$ is the strength of the DC field. Under the weak electric field regime, the laser intensity after passing through Rydberg atoms can be written as

$$
I(t) \propto E_{d}^{2}+E_{k}^{2}+2 E_{d} E_{k} \cos \left(\omega_{k} t+\varphi_{k}\right)
$$

As a result, the modulation signals oscillate at the frequency $\omega_{\mathrm{k}}$, and is linear proportional to the strength $E_{\mathrm{k}}$ of the kHz signal field. According to Equation (3), the DC field acts as an amplifier of the kHz signal field with a coefficient of $2 E_{\mathrm{d}}$. To achieve high sensitivity measurement of the kHz signal field, an auxiliary DC field can be introduced into Rydberg-atom sensor.

To conduct electric field measurements by Rydberg-atom sensor, it is needed to calibrate the field strength, which can be calculated as

$$
E=K \mathrm{~V} C d
$$

where V is the amplitude of the voltage displayed on the signal generator, C represents an effective voltage coefficient, that $C=\sqrt{2}$ for the AC signal field and $C=1$ for the DC field, d is the spacing between two electrode plates of 18 mm in our vapor cell, K is a calibration coefficient. Using Eq. (1) and (4), the calibration coefficient K is obtained through linear fitting in a region of strong electric field, which is 0.458 , 0.439, 0.443 and 1.185 , respectively for 1 kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz signal fields and DC field. The significant difference in the calibration coefficients between the kHz signal and the DC fields arises from the use of an attenuator with an insertion loss for the strength of the kHz signal fields. Further to achieve high sensitivity measurement of the kHz signal fields, we optimized the strength of the DC electric field to maximize the intensity of the kHz modulation signals received by the Rydberg atoms. Then, we conducted sensitivity tests for the kHz signal fields with the frequency of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz , which represents measurements of ULF, VLF and LF bands, respectively. Using the spectrum analysis of the oscilloscope, the power of modulation signals oscillating at the same frequency of the kHz signal fields is measured under different strength of the signal field with a measurement integration time of 100 ms . Presented in Fig. 3, the minimum detectable field at frequencies of $1 \mathrm{kHz}, 10 \mathrm{kHz}$ and 100 kHz is down to $18.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}, 6.9 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$ and $3.0 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$, and the linear dynamic range is 51 dB , 63 dB and 61 dB , respectively.

The sensitivity of electric field measurements by Rydberg-atom sensor is estimated as

$$
S=E_{\min } / \sqrt{R B W}
$$

where $E_{\text {min }}$ is the minimum detectable field by the sensor, and RBW is the resolution bandwidth, which is 10 Hz in our measurements. The corresponding sensitivity of the Rydberg-atom sensor is $5.7 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, $2.2 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ and $0.95 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ for the 1 kHz , 10 kHz and 100 kHz signal fields, respectively. For comparison, the sensitivity of the dipole antenna with a length of 1 cm is calculated as a function of the frequency of electric field [4]. And the sensitivity of the reported Rydberg-atom sensors with frequency ranged from 100Hz to 200Mhz [12-16], is also attached in Fig. 4. For the kHz fields, the sensitivity of Rydberg-atom sensor is at the same level of $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with the MHz fields. What is more, the sensitivity achieved with Rydberg-atom sensor is superior to the theoretical sensitivity limit of 1 cm dipole antennas, and the advantage is more pronounced with lower frequency electric fields in ULF, VLF bands.

# 4. Conclusion 

We have conducted an in-depth study on the application of Rydberg atoms for kHz electric field sensing, specifically focusing on the ULF, VLF, and LF bands. Our research demonstrates that the use of built-in parallel electrode plates can effectively overcome shielding effects, providing a novel technical approach for electric field measurement in these frequency ranges. By enhanced with a DC electric field, we have done measurements of 1 kHz, 10 kHz and 100 kHz signal fields with the corresponding sensitivity of $5.7 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}, 2.2 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ and $0.95 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. To our knowledge, this is the first publication on the sensitivity of Rydberg-atom sensors in the VLF and LF bands. Our results represent that kHz field measurement based on Rydberg-atom sensor has exceeded the limit of dipole antennas with the same size. Rydberg sensing technology is capable of leveraging ULF, VLF, and LF fields for applications in remote timing, auxiliary navigation, as well as radio communication.
