## Abstract

The Japanese rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus kurumeus) is facing imminent extinction because of hybridization and competition from an invasive alien subspecies (Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus). Eleven new microsatellite markers for the two subspecies were developed using dinucleotide repeat specific polymerase chain reaction. The number of alleles per locus and the heterozygosity in R. o. kurumeus were lower than those in R. o. ocellatus. Most of these microsatellite markers were successfully cross-amplified in three Acheilognathinae species.

Two subspecies of the rose bitterling, Rhodeus ocellatus kurumeus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae) and R. o. ocellatus, inhabit Japan. Rhodeus o. kurumeus is endemic and facing extinction brought about by both hybridization and competition from an invasive alien subspecies, R. o. ocellatus. Rhodeus o. kurumeus is currently listed as a Critically Endangered species in the Red Data Book of the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. Clear and convenient identification of the two subspecies is needed to protect R. o. kurumeus from extinction. However, there have been no adequate molecular markers for R. ocellatus. We present the characterization of 11 new microsatellite markers for R. ocellatus and their applicability to three related species.

We amplified DNA fragments from the genomic DNA sample of R. o. kurumeus using dinucleotide repeat specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described by Fisher et al. (1996). The PCR mixture consisted of 20 ng genomic DNA, $100 \mathrm{nmol} 5^{\prime}$-anchored primer (PCT6; KKVRVRVCTCTCTC TCTCT, or PCA6; KKBRBRBCACACACACACA), $800 \mu \mathrm{m}$ dNTPs, $0.02 \mathrm{U} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB), and $1 \times$ ThermoPol Buffer [NEB, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1\% Triton X-100, pH 8.8 ) in 10- $\mu$ L reaction volume. The temperature-cycle conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at $94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; followed by 40 cycles of 25 s at $94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 60 \mathrm{~s}$ at $57^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and 45 s at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; and final extension for 7 min at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The amplified DNA was cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega) using TA cloning protocol and the ligations were chemically transformed into DH5 $\alpha$ (Toyobo). The insert fragments with enough length to design PCR primers were sequenced on a PRISM 3100 Automated Capillary DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using a DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Eleven primer pairs were designed using Primer 3 software (Rozen \& Skaletsky 2000) from the sequence data of 70 clones.

To evaluate the applicability of the microsatellite markers, we used the genomic DNA samples prepared from 20 individuals each of both subspecies. Individuals of R. o. kurumeus and R. o. ocellatus were collected from two ponds in the same area ( 10 each) and one stream, respectively. The PCR mixture contained 20 ng of genomic DNA, 100 nm each of forward and reverse primer, $800 \mu \mathrm{m}$ dNTPs, $1.3 \mu \mathrm{m}$ FITCdUTP (Roche Diagnostics), $0.02 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ of Taq DNA Polymerase (NEB), and $1 \times$ ThermoPol Buffer in 10- $\mu \mathrm{L}$ reaction volume. The temperature-cycle conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 C ; followed by 30 cycles

of 15 s at $94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 30 \mathrm{~s}$ at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and 20 s at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; and final extension for 7 min at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The amplified microsatellite markers were mixed with three volumes of formamide dye solution ( $95 \%$ formamide, $10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{EDTA} \mathrm{Na}_{2}, 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ bluedextran), heat denatured at $94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 3 min and run with MapMarker (BioVenture) on a $5 \%$ PAGE-PLUS (Amresco) - 8 M urea denaturing gel using a DSQ-1000 Slab Gel DNA Sequencer (Shimadzu Biotech).

The characteristics of newly developed microsatellite markers are shown in Table 1. Estimations of the expected and observed heterozygosities and the assessment of HardyWeinberg equilibrium and linkage disequilibria were carried out using GenePop version 3.4 (Raymond \& Rousset 1995). In R. o. kurumeus, five and six out of 11 microsatellite markers were monomorphic and polymorphic, respectively. Exact tests of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and estimates of linkage disequilibrium in the case of polymorphic markers were not significant after sequential Bonferroni correction (Rice 1989). Conversely, in R. o. ocellatus, all the microsatellite markers were multi-allelic. The heterozygosities of all markers except RC364 were high, with numbers of alleles ranging from six to 12. Exact tests of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were significant in RC306, RC364 and RC688 after sequential Bonferroni correction. The deviation may result from the small sample size or the presence of null alleles. The contribution of the latter was analysed with Micro-Checker (van Oosterhout et al. 2004). The estimated frequencies of null alleles at RC306, RC364 and RC688 were 0.16,0.38 and 0.14 , respectively, indicating that the deviation is likely to be caused by null alleles. The linkage disequilibria in R. o. ocellatus were not significant in all locus pairs after sequential Bonferroni correction.
Twenty individuals of R. o. kurumeus were classified into 18 genotypes using a combination of six markers (RC236, 292, 363, 364, 625 and 772). In addition, all the microsatellite markers except RC236 were cross-amplified successfully in three other Acheilognathinae species (Table 2). Therefore, these microsatellite markers are not only useful for research of the genetic structure of R. o. ocellatus and the conservation of R. o. kurumeus, but are also possibly applicable to other related endangered Acheilognathinae species such as Tanakia tanago.
