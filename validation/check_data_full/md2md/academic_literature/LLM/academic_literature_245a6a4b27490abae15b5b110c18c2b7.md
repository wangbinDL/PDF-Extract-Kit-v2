#### Abstract

This study investigated the role of a district irrigation canal in Nevada County, California, USA, as the point source of infection for Neorickettsia risticii, causative agent of equine neorickettsiosis (EN). A total of 568 freshwater snails comprising Juga spp., Planorbella subcrenata (Carpenter, 1857) (Rough Rams-
horn), Physella virgata (Gould, 1855) (Protean Physa) and feces from three horses with EN were collected and tested for N. risticii by real-time PCR. A total of four freshwater snails tested PCR positive for N. risticii. Phylogenetic analysis showed $99.8-100 \%$ homology between the different snail and horse N. risticii isolates. This study represents the first report of infection with N. risticii in Planorbella subcrenata and suggests that the irrigation canal was the aquatic environment responsible for the spread of N . risticii.

Neorickettsia risticii is the etiologic agent of equine neorickettsiosis (EN), or Potomac horse fever (PHF), an acute enterocolitis of horses. Neorickettsia risticii has recently been associated with trematode-vectors, which use freshwater snails and aquatic insects as intermediate hosts and insectivorous birds and bats as definitive hosts (Pusterla et al., 2003; Gibson et al., 2005). In Northern California, the species of snail incriminated in the life cycle of the helminth vector infected with N. risticii has been identified as Juga yrekaensis (Henderson, 1935, [Yreka juga]), a common pleurocerid snail, which inhabits fresh or brackish stream water in the Northwestern United States (Barlough et al., 1998). Additionally, DNA from N. risticii has been detected in virgulate cercariae in lymnaeid snails (Stagnicola spp.) from Northern California, in virgulate xiphidiocercariae isolated from pleurocerid snails (Elimia livescens, (Menke, 1830), [Liver Elimia]) in central Ohio, and from pleurocerid snails (Elimia virginica, (Say, 1817), [Piedmont Elimia]) in central Pennsylvania, indicating that other species of freshwater snails may also harbor infected trematodes (Reubel et al., 1998; Kanter et al., 2000).

In recent years, there have been an increasing number of reported EN cases from Nevada County, California. Of epidemiological interest is the fact that water is supplied to the premises where confirmed EN cases have historically been diagnosed through a district irrigation canal system. The aim of this study was, therefore, to determine if freshwater snails collected from these canals harbored N. risticii.

A total of 568 freshwater snails, including 218 Juga spp., 140 Planorbella subcrenata and 210 Physella virgata (Fig. 1), were collected from five different sites along the irrigation canal from September 2010 to August 2011 (Fig. 2). Each snail was extracted from its shell using clean forceps and scalpel blades, and placed into a 96-well plate containing $500 \mu \mathrm{L}$ of lysis solution. All extraction steps were performed in a hood with laminar flow. Proteinase K and two grinding beads ( 4 mm diameter, stainless steel beads, SpexCertiprep) were added and the tissues homogenized in a GenoGrinder2000 (SpexCertiprep) for 2 min at 1000 strokes per minute.

Protein digest was at $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min followed by a 30 min period at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to reduce foam. Two hundred microliters of the mixture were processed for DNA purification using an automated extraction protocol as previously reported (Pusterla et al., 2000a).

Extracted nucleic acids were tested for the presence of N. risticii by real-time PCR using a previously established and validated protocol (Pusterla et al., 2000a). Known positive and negative controls were used with every PCR run. Furthermore, a real-time PCR assay targeting the universal eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene was used as quality control (i.e. efficiency of DNA purification and amplification) and as an indicator of inhibition (Eukaryotic 18S rRNA Endogenous Control, Applied Biosystems).

Three horses diagnosed with PHF from different localities in Nevada County were used for phylogenetic analysis. A 527 nucleotide segment of the 16S rRNA gene of N. risticii was generated from the snail and horse isolates in order to determine phylogenetic relationship (Reubel et al., 1998).

Nucleic acid extraction was successful in all 568 freshwater snails based on the detection of the 18S rRNA gene. Four freshwater snails tested PCR positive for N. risticii. These included one Juga species ( $0.4 \%$ ) and three P. subcrenata (2.1\%) snails, but none of the P. virgata snails tested PCR positive for N. risticii. All three horses presented to Loomis Basin Equine Medical Center with classical signs of EN, including depression, anorexia, fever, colic and softformed feces tested PCR positive for N. risticii in feces (Bertin et al., 2011). Sequence comparison of a 527 nucleotide segment of the 16S rRNA gene of N. risticii showed $100 \%$ homology amongst the snails and between $99.3 \%$ and $100.0 \%$ homology with the three horses from Nevada County (Fig. 3).

The biology of N. risticii is associated with an aquatic environment, which explains why EN cases have a seasonal occurrence and are commonly observed near waterways in endemic areas (Barlough et al., 1998). This study reports on the detection of N. risticii in freshwater snails and horses from Nevada County, California. This newly recognized endemic area is geographically distinct from other endemic areas in California, which are located close to the Oregon border. In the rural area of Nevada County water is provided via a canal system from April to October and used mainly for local agriculture, including pasture irrigation. The water originates from Scotts Flat Reservoir and is carried in an open canal system for over 150 miles (ca. 241 km) to approximately 32,000 irrigable acres (ca. 13,000 ha). To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report associating a district irrigation canal system with the spread of N. risticii.

Fig. 3. Phylogenetic relationship of field strains of N. risticii from snails and horses with PHF from California and other endemic areas of the United States (Siskiyou County, California; Ohio; Illinois, Oregon). The field isolates are labeled by species (snail or horse) and location (County or State). Analyses were done using the MEGA 5.10 version Beta 4 software package.

Demonstrating endemic occurrence of N. risticii was based on the detection of the neorickettsial organism in freshwater snails and resident horses with signs compatible with EN. Previous work has shown that the number of PCR positive snails appears to depend on the size of the snails, the month of collection, and geographic origin (Pusterla et al., 2000b). In the present study, we detected a prevalence of infected freshwater snails ranging from $0.4 \%$ to $2.1 \%$ which is in agreement with previous reports (Barlough et al., 1998; Pusterla et al., 2000b). Juga yrekaensis is considered the main species of freshwater snails associated with the life cycle of the digenetic trematode vectors of N . risticii in Northern California (Reubel et al., 1998). This was in contrast with the present study, where the majority of the PCR positive freshwater snails belonged to Planorbella subcrenata. This planorbid snail is common in the Northwestern United States and can be recognized by its sinistrally-coiled shell (Burch, 1989). Previous work has shown that in endemic areas various freshwater snail species can harbor N . risticii (Reubel et al., 1998).

EN was diagnosed in the horses from Nevada County based on clinical signs, laboratory detection of N. risticii via PCR and response to treatment with oxytetracycline and supportive care as previously reported (Bertin et al., 2011). All the affected horses had direct access to irrigated pastures and lived 100-300 m from the nearest irrigation canal. The close relationship between freshwater snail and horse N. risticii isolates was further supported by the high sequence homology of the partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of N. risticii (Reubel et al., 1998). The study represents the first report of infection with N. risticii in Planorbella subcrenata and suggests that the irrigation canal was the aquatic environment responsible for the spread of N. risticii.
