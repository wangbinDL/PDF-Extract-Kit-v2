ABSTRACT. The dose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva was examined on two occasions 4 yr apart in a group of Japanese lead workers with blood lead concentrations below $2.0 \mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}(40 \mu \mathrm{g} / 100 \mathrm{~g})$. In the two examinations, $12 \%$ and $18 \%$ of the total group of workers and $17 \%$ and $24 \%$ of the smokers had melanin pigmentation. The prevalence of pigmentation was significantly higher in smokers who inhaled more than 10 cigarettes per day $(17 \%$ and $25 \%$ ) than in nonsmokers $(0 \%$ and $2 \%$ ), and tended to increase significantly with tobacco consumption. Lead absorption, however, was not associated with melanin pigmentation.

Melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva among tobacco smokers, i.e., "smokers' melanosis," was first described in white Europeans by Hedin, ${ }^{1}$ and was noted among Japanese by one of the present authors. ${ }^{2}$ Histologically, in this condition, melanin is deposited in the basal layer of the epithelium without evidence of malignancy. ${ }^{1}$

Pigmentation of the gingiva is often found among American Negroes, ${ }^{3}$ black Africans, ${ }^{4}$ native Australians, ${ }^{5}$ and Greenland Eskimos. ${ }^{6}$ Heavy metal intoxication (e.g., "classical" lead poisoning), Yusho disease (PCB poisoning), and some serious systemic illnesses also can cause various types of gingival pigmentation. ${ }^{7,8}$

Among Japanese, it was reported in 1928 that $32 \%$ of the people who visited or were admitted to hospitals had pigmentation of the oral mucosa and that $56 \%$ of those with the pigmentation were smokers; ${ }^{9}$ another Japanese report noted that the prevalence of pigmentation was $5 \%{ }^{10}$ According to a recent study, 62 of 94 cases of malignant melanoma in the oral cavity were associated with pigmentation of the gingiva and other oral mucosa. ${ }^{11}$ It should be especially noted that 34 cases were preceded by the pigmentation, to which the name of "precancerous melanosis" was given. ${ }^{11}$

In this study, we evaluate a dose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and the gingival

tion and prevalence of gingival pigmentation. Evidence for a causal relationship between tobacco smoking and pigmentation is strengthened by this study.

The pigmentation rate was significantly higher in smokers who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day than in nonsmokers; the average duration of smoking was more than 14 yr (Table 1). Analyses of the effect of smoking duration on the pigmentation rate and on its reversibility would be required to determine more precisely the dose-response relationship.

The following findings indicate that lead absorption does not cause melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva below the blood lead concentration of 2.0 $\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{kg}(40 \mu \mathrm{g} / 100 \mathrm{~g})$.
(1) No significant difference in the pigmentation rate was found between the three blood lead levels examined.
(2) The pigmentation rate remained unchanged in spite of a decrease in blood lead concentrations over 4 yr of observation. In fact, the rate minimally, though not significantly, increased during this period, probably because most smokers continued to smoke during the period.
(3) Macroscopic (and microscopic) findings in the pigmented gingiva did not coincide with those typical of the lead line in "classical" lead poisoning. The lead line can be observed along the margin of the gingiva and is characterized by distribution of lead sulfide granules in the blood vessel walls and the connective tissue papillae. ${ }^{14}$

The pigmentation rate among the Japanese in this study was close to that reported previously among white Europeans in Sweden ( $13 \%$ and $15 \%$ ). ${ }^{1}$ Therefore, it is suggested that no substantial racial difference exists between Japanese and Europeans in the pigmentation rate. The rate is assumed to be determined by smoking rates.

A possible effect of nicotine on the melanin-containing cells in the gingiva, as well as in the inner ear, has been suggested to be the cause of "smokers' melanosis." ${ }^{1}$ Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the development of this type of melanosis. Similarly, follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether this apparently benign melanosis can develop into malignant melanoma or other oral malignancy.
