# AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE TEACHING OF CURRENT EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE GRADES 

MARY G. KELTY<br>Chicago, Illinois

NELLE E. MOORE<br>Supervisor of Elementary Education, Wilmette, Illinois

In the period during and immediately following the World War, great interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in the schools. Many junior and senior high schools experimented with methods and materials in current events and adopted a regular program, either providing special classes in the subject or working out a definite correlation with history, civics, or oral English. Periodically suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the elementary schools have occasionally been put forward, but so far as the writers are aware, these suggestions have not been given serious consideration. The general feeling seems to have been that children in the middle grades are too immature, their background of information too restricted, and their reading ability too limited to warrant the expectation that they might be able to understand present-day problems.

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades. After several semesters many of them gave up the attempt, feeling that the available materials to be unsuited for the use of younger children. Others have continued the study during one reading period a week for a year or two, even though they did not feel fully satisfied with the results. Few of them, however, so far as the writers are aware, have made any attempt to measure results or to present evidence as to the children's understanding or interest.

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in the field of elementary education. The results of the great improvement in silent reading, begun about the time of the World War, are beginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire school system.

school system, especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of suitable reading materials is being keenly felt. At the same time there has been tempted in the social sciences a very genuine and widespread reorganization of materials, with the objective of choosing those that are most significant and activities in line with social values and life-situations. Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience as possible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom. Valuable allies for such an attempt are now furnished by the news reels in the motion-picture houses and by the rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers, both of which are usually available to elementary-school children throughout the country.

Like all other students of the social sciences, the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investigate their effects on the ability of middle-grade children to read current events. Most opportunely, an invitation came to them to undertake for a period of two years, ending in June, 1931, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.

The first problem was the setting-up of an educational program. It was obvious that materials chosen for young children should be subjected to a double test: (1) accuracy and (2) suitability to children's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.

# GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 

I. [Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourthgrade work.] Most fourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.

2. A complete résumé of the news of the world is unsuited to the interests and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades. Topics should be fully selected, and only a few should be presented at one time.
3. A variety of interests should be built up-political, geographical, economic, mechanical, artistic, scientific, etc. Foreign news should be given as well as domestic news.
4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an important phase of world-news. It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding. A few other short articles (perhaps two to four) may deal with other selected topics.
5. When feasible, the leading articles may well alternate foreign and domestic news. They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.
6. In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly constituted a leading article.
7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appearance in a current-events paper. The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.
8. Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to current events, the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour a week.
9. Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers produced for adults, the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.
10. Children's information can be tested. Their interest in the materials, however, can best be judged by their classroom teachers.

# THE CONDUCTING OF THE EXPERIMENT 

From the outset the experiment faced a serious difficulty in connection with the physical makeup of the paper. The fact that the newsprint used was 52 by 8 inches in size necessitated the use of very small type, which seriously impaired the value of the few pictures that were included. The results secured were attained in spite of the poor appearance of the paper. Teachers were helped in making the news more interesting, however, by a sheet on "Topics for Discussion of Current Events," which was sent out at the beginning of the year. A mimeographed sheet, "Notes for Teachers of Current Events," was sent each week. It contained summaries of each issue's articles and lists of other publications dealing with the leading topic. Each weekly issue contained a leading article, from 750 to 1,000 words in length, two or three shorter articles, and an entire page devoted to tests in various forms. The tests were informal objective tests of the leading article. The "activities" suggested things to investigate, to make, to read, to find out about, for the purpose of prompting interest and to develop understanding.

All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grade classes. They also followed the reactions of several groups of children in city and rural schools to differing types of materials that were presented weekly. At the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the test program might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of the publishers the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children in twenty-one states were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to administer the weekly tests, record their results on a tabulation sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. Some teachers reported for one, two, or three terms but did not continue through the entire year. These schools represented large city, small city, and rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations. The publishers also generously co-operated in printing and distributing record sheets.

In addition to a tabulation of the test results, the teachers were asked to furnish the following information.

## THE FINDINGS

In order that the reader may understand the type of events material used in the study, the titles of the foreign and domestic news stories are given in Table I. The classifications into political, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the story by the newspaper. A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices of news stories in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. Sixteen different stories of domestic news ranked first, second, or third in the preferences of these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received favorable mention. Seven of the favorite stories are classified as political, five as geographical, and three as economic. The choices of these children seem to indicate that for the most part, sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and

average of 95 , the weight of each child being counted $n / N$ times, where $n$ is the number of children in a grade or group and $N$ the total number in the school. The weights in the third school are not for the first of October but for the fourteenth of September. The last column gives the number of children who have increased in weight during the period between the two dates, while the second to the last column shows the number of those who have decreased. If we divide the sum of the averages of the two weights by 2 we have the average weight of the entire school for the two dates.


This is more than the deficiency in weight as determined from heights. The number of children who had decreased in weight was 13 per cent of the total number in the schools according to the first weighing and 12.7 per cent according to the second weighing; or, in other words, nearly one child in eight was actually losing in weight.
The question naturally arises as to whether or not the lack of gain in height and weight which has been shown might not be made up between the close of the school term in June and the opening of the term in September (August or September). Data are not available to answer this question definitely. The experience of the investigator and of many teachers (which is also supported by the evidence of working children in the shops who are not obliged to go to school) would indicate that if any gain is made it is probably slight and in no case equals the deficiency found in height and weight in September, which should have been made up during the school term. The evidence will be given in a later paper that in the Cuyahoga County Infirmary, where 104 children under five years of age were being reared by a practical nurse, the average gain was 250 grams per month, or six times the gain found in these schools.

## TABLE III

## DISTRIBUTION OF TYPES OF ILLUSTRATIONS ACCOMPANYING STORIES CHOSEN BY PUPILS

 Table III shows the types of illustrations which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories of the thirty-five had no front-page illustration. Significance may be attached to the fact that fourteen of the stories chosen as first, second, or third choices had front-page pictures.

While this study secured no data as to the advisability of a newsaper from the point of view of size of the paper, the experimenters feel that the need for a larger news is imperative. A larger paper with larger type, of course, cost much more than the middle-grade papers now available, and no commercial firm can be expected to place a paper on the market unless the schoois can give it adequate support. The publication of such a paper would appear to require subsidizing by a foundation interested in eduJation.

An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of the news stories through objective tests-true-false, multiple-choice, and completion of outlines. A comparison of the results with the reading scores in The Metropolitan is Reading Tests, made at the beginning of the school year, showed no definite relation between ease of reading and comprehension.

cording to choices shows little or no relation between choice and ease of reading. However, the scores of the pupils on all the other tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the stories had been apprehended by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores were consistently made on the true-false and the multiple-choice types of tests, the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were determined by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading the stories. Table IV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.

The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families take daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take daily papers and that between 6o per cent and 70 per cent take weekly papers. Teachers reported that about 50 per cent of the pupils gave evidence of reading newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting current information to the class.

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to language difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the language suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of material in the News Outline was sufficient to serve the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.

# CONCLUSIONS 

The data seem to justify the following conclusions. (1) Children in important world-news of a variety of types, including political, historical, geographical, economic, and social, can be comprehended by fifth- and sixth-grade pupils. (2) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can read world-news intelligently if it is presented to them with proper explanations and in language suitable for young children. (3) Classroom use of a current-events periodical seems to introduce pupils to important phases of world-news encourages reading of newspapers outside of class and serves as a guide to home reading. (4) Attractive illustrations influence pupils toward reading stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including enough material for a thirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
