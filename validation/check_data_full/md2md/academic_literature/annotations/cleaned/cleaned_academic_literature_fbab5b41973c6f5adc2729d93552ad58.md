Summary Reciprocal crosses between Brassica carinata (BBCC, $2 n=34$ ) and B. tournefortii (TT, $2 n=20$ ) were attempted in order to determine crossability between the species, carry out chromosomal associations among the $\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{T}$ genomes, and to study morphology of the interspecific hybrids. A hybrid between these 2 species was obtained only when $B$. carinata was used as a female parent. Morphologically, the hybrid was intermediate between the progenitor species but its leaves resembled $B$. carinata. The $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ plant was tall but grew very slowly. The hybrid was almost male sterile, showing only $2.3 \%$ pollen stainability. Meiotic studies of trigenomic triploid hybrid (BCT, $2 n=27$ ) showed various chromosome configurations including quadrivalents $(0-1)$, trivalents $(0-2)$, bivalents (2-9) and univalents (5-23). Only 5 univalents were recorded to have occurred; otherwise trivalents and bivalents were observed in pollen mother cells of the BCT hybrid. A few chromosomal association could be expected through allosyndesis which suggests the possibility of transferring genes across the species through interspecific hybridization.

Ethiopian or Abyssinian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun, $2 n=34$ ) possesses many desirable characteristics that are rare in the other Brassica oil crops: heat and drought tolerance, tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses and availability of yellow-seeded germplasm (Jiang et al. 2007). Inspite of these positive attributes, the crop suffers from many agronomic limitations like longer crop duration, poor harvest index, low oil content etc., whereas B. tournefortii $(2 n=20)$, known variously as wild turnip or Sahara mustard or Asian mustard or Tournefort's mustard or Tournefort's Birdrape, grown sporadically in a few pockets of arid and semi-arid areas, has a strategy of early and quick growth because this effectively captures available soil moisture, enables it to build a canopy, reproduce and mature before neighbouring species (Minnich and Sanders 2000). It has also been reported as having a good source of tolerance against aphids (Singh et al. 1965) and drought (West and Nabhan 2002). However, lower test weight (2-3g/1000 seed) and susceptibility to downy mildew (Rajpurohit and Choudhary 1995) are the major constraints in the spread of this species.

Interspecific hybridization has great potential for the improvement of Brassica. Besides the transfer of useful traits across the species in genus Brassica (Roy 1984, Rahman 2001, Rygulla et al. 2007), such crosses were widely used to create genetic variability (Prakash 1973a), genetic diversity (Choudhary and Joshi 2001) and to synthesize artificially new species such as Brassicoraphanus (Tokumasu 1970) Brassica napocampestris (McNaughton 1973) and Raphanofortii (Choudhary et al. 2000a). Both B. carinata and B. tournefortii species have their own advantage and deficiencies. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine crossabil-ity between $B$. carinata and $B$. tournefortii and to observe the meiotic behaviour of the interspecific $F_{1}$ hybrid of these species as it suggests the possibility of genetic introgressions for crop improvements which take place through chromosomal interchange.

## Materials and methods

Two genotypes of $B$. tournefortii (TT, $2 n=20$ ) - RBT 58 and RBT 61 - and 1 of $B$. carinata (BBCC, $2 n=34)-B C N$ selected from the germplasm collection of the Agricultural Research Station, Mandor-Jodhpur, India were used in the hybridization programme.

The reciprocal interspecific crosses were attempted involving the selected genotypes of both the species under field conditions. Emasculation and pollination were conducted as per the given procedure. Immature flower buds of appropriate size were emasculated by removal of anthers in the evening and bagged with butter paper bags. In the following morning, stigma of these buds were pollinated with pollen of the desired parent and the racemes were re-enclosed with bags to prevent cross pollination. Seeds obtained from crosses and parents were grown in the field for evaluation. Morphological comparisons were made, and the meiosis of the interspecific hybrid was studied.

For meiotic analysis, young flower buds were fixed in freshly prepared solution of propionic acid: absolute ethanol $(1: 3)$ containing ferric chloride as a mordent. After $24 \mathrm{~h}$ the rinsed flower buds were stored in $70 \%$ ethanol until slides were made by the acetocarmine (1\%) squash technique. Chromosome associations were observed at diakinesis/metaphase I. Pollen fertility of the hybrid and parents was estimated by pollen grain stainability in acetocarmine ( $1 \%$ ).

## Results

## Crossability

The seed setting was almost double in the cross $B$. carinata $\times B$. tournefortii compared to its reciprocal combination. Out of 112 flowers buds of $B$. carinata pollinated with pollen of $B$. tournefortii, 22 seeds were obtained giving rise to only a single hybrid plant. On contrary, in the reciprocal combination, out of 122 buds of $B$. tournefortii pollinated by B. carinata pollen, only 11 seeds were obtained which did not yield any true hybrids.

## Morphological features of $F_{1}$ hybrids

The phenotype of the hybrid was intermediate between parent species. The size and shape of leaves of the hybrid were closer to B. carinata. They were obovate-lanceolate, petiolate, pinnatified to pinnatipartite with entire to slightly dentate margin, obtuse tip, sparsely hairy and dark green in colour. The flowers were medium in size with pale yellow petals but their shape was similar to $B$. tournefortii. The hybrid was tall but grew very slowly and took as many as $95 \mathrm{~d}$ to flower and $168 \mathrm{~d}$ to mature completely (Table 1). The $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ plant exhibited enhancement in values of attributes like primary and secondary branches, main raceme length, siliquae on main raceme and siliquae per plant. On the other hand, siliqua length, seeds per siliqua, seed weight and seed yield were recorded much lower in the hybrid compared to either of the parents. Few seeds were set in the $F_{1}$ plant due to open pollination. However, no seed set was found under self-pollination or in backcrosses.

## Meiotic characteristics of $F_{1}$ hybrids

The chromosome associations observed in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the trihaploid BCT hybrid ( $2 n=27)$ are given in Table 2 and some representative cells are shown in Figs. 1-3. A total of 59 PMCs of the hybrid were analyzed at diakinesis/metaphase I. At least 2 bivalents were observed in all the PMCs, but the maximum of 9 bivalents were observed in $17 \%$ of cells (Fig. 2). Many of them exhibited chiasmatic configurations (Fig. 2). Multivalents in the form of trivalents (0-2) and quadrivalents $(0-1)$ were also noticed in the majority of PMCs (59.4\%). Only 5 univalents were observed in a single cell; the rest were trivalents and bivalents. The mode of chromosome association observed was 2 III+7 II+7 I (16.9\%), 1 III+7 II+10 I (13.6\%) 9 II+9 I (11.9\%), $1 \mathrm{III}+8 \mathrm{II}+8 \mathrm{I}(8.5 \%)$ and $7 \mathrm{II}+13 \mathrm{I}$ (8.5\%). On an average, each PMC had shown an association of $0.02 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{IV}+0.77 \pm 0.10 \mathrm{III}+$ $6.69 \pm 0.25 \mathrm{II}+11.20 \pm 0.59 \mathrm{I}$.

The stickiness and delayed terminalisation of the chiasmata made it difficult to determine the exact nature of the chromosome association observed (Fig. 4). Further, it was not always possible to distinguish between the relatively small bivalents of the $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{T}$ genome(s) and the relatively large univalents of the $\mathrm{C}$ genome. In the majority of the cases, well-defined metaphase plates could not be recognized as the bivalents did not congress at the equatorial plate but rather were distributed randomly throughout the cell. Bivalent and trivalent associations were observed even at late anaphase I. Distribution of chromosomes at anaphase (I/II) was random due to unequal disjunction. Bridge-fragment configurations were observed in $12.5 \%$ of cells (Fig. 5). The majority of cells had laggards at both anaphases I (Figs. 5, 6) and II. The complete process of meiosis was found to be irregular. Most of the cells did not divide synchronously; monads and dyads were observed in high frequency. These meiotic irregularities might be the reason for pollen being mostly sterile. The percentage of stainable pollen recorded in the hybrid was only $2.3 \%$.

## Discussion

The hybrid from cross $B$. carinata $a$ B. tournefortii was obtained only when $B$. carinata was used as a female parent. This was not anticipated as in the majority of interspecific crosses reported in Brassica, there was greater success when the species with the higher basic chromosome number was used as a female (Quazi 1988, Choudhary and Joshi 1999). Nishiyama et al. (1991) reported that crosses between tetraploid and diploid species were partly successful, while the reciprocal, i.e. diploidxtetraploid, usually failed. However, the occurrence of the hybrid in the direction of $B$. carinata $\times B$. tournefortii in the present study is in contradiction to Harberd's theory that interspecific crosses with $B$. tournefortii were only possible when it was used as a female parent (Harberd 1976).

The sexual hybrid between B. carinata and B. tournefortii was reported for the first time by us (Joshi and Choudhary 1999). The hybrid plant was observed to be an intermediate in terms of many phenotypic features of both the parents. This is an advantage, since it would allow better selection for specific attributes in segregating progenies.

Meiotic studies of trigenomic triploid hybrid BCT $(2 n=27)$ revealed various chromosome configurations including quadrivalents $(0-1)$, trivalents $(0-2)$ and bivalents $(2-9)$. Based on earlier studies on haploid genomes of B (Prakash 1973b), C (Armstrong and Keller 1982) and T (Prakash 1974), a total of 7 bivalents were theoretically possible due to autosyndesis in these 3 genomes. Hence, out of the maximum of 9 bivalents observed in the present hybrid, 2 could be expected to be due to allosyndesis among the B, C and T genomes. Mizushima (1968) noticed a maximum of 3 bivalents in a TC hybrid and opined that one of them might be due to allosyndesis between these 2 genomes, while Ljungberg et al. (1993) observed a maximum of 1 III+3 II+10 I in a similar hybrid and suggested the possibility of allosyndetic pairing in $\mathrm{T}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ genomes. Narain and Prakash (1972) reported a maximum of 3 bivalents in a BT hybrid but did not say anything regarding the nature of origin of such bivalents. Sarla and Raut (1991) found a maximum of 1 III+5 II+4 I in BC hybrid and demonstrated homology between the B and C genomes. Pairing in the present triploid hybrid has been assumed to occur mostly between the B and C genomes. However, less than 10 univalents (possibly of $\mathrm{T}$ genome) were counted in $45.8 \%$ of all PMCs, suggesting that some $\mathrm{T}$ chromosomes of B. tournefortii might have been involved in the pairing with B and C chromosomes.

The high level of pairing observed in the hybrid might be due to auto/allosyndesis pairing within and among the genomes. This might be attributed to structural similarities and duplications of some of the chromosomes (Röbbelen 1960). However, the heteromorphic appearance of bivalents in some of the PMCs observed and the presence of only 5 univalents, instead of the 27 expected, indicated the extent of homology among B, C and T genomes. Bridges at anaphase I observed in the present material might have resulted from pairing between partially chromosomes of the parent genomes. Such inter-genomic pairing in Brassica hybrid was also observed by Howard (1938). The occurrence of multivalent association at a high frequency in the hybrid studied indicated that parts of the chromosomes of these genomes possess sufficient affinity to allow multivalent association (Newell et al. 1984). This showed that some of chromosomes of these 3 genomes had duplicate archetypes and confirmed the hypothesis of the secondary polyploidy origin of the B, $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{T}$ genomes. Secondly, the lower average chromosome association observed in the present BCT hybrid, compared to that reported in an ABC hybrid by Choudhary et al. (2000b), suggested that the $\mathrm{T}$ genome was more distantly related than $\mathrm{A}$ to both the $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ genomes. Inter-genomic chromosome associations noticed in the hybrid indicated the possibility of transferring genes across the species through interspecific hybridization.
