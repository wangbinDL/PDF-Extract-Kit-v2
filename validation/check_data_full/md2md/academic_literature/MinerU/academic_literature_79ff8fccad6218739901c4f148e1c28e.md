Abstract.  We investigated the effect of ecabet sodium (ecabet)  on rat acute esophageal lesions induced by reﬂ  ux of gastric  juice. Ligation of both pylorus and fore-stomach induced the  reﬂ  ux of gastric juice, decreased the amount of mucus and  formed hemorrhagic lesions in the esophageal mucosa. In- tragastric injection of ecabet reduced the pepsin activity and  prevented both the decrease of mucus amount and formation  of lesions. Ecabet enhanced the reduction in lesion forma- tion induced by omeprazole and ranitidine without a change  in decreased acid concentration and pepsin activity. Diges- tion of mucosa and the reduction in mucus were prevented  by ecabet in the everted HCl and pepsin treated esophageal  sac. These results indicate that ecabet prevents esophageal  lesions by inhibiting pepsin activity as well as by protecting  mucus from degradation. These further implicate the thera- peutic potential of ecabet for prevention/treatment of GERD,  especially in combination with a proton pump inhibitor or   $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  -antagonist.

# Introduction  

Gastro-esophageal reﬂ  ex disease (GERD) is a clinical condi- tion that occurs when reﬂ  ux of gastric acid into the esopha- gus is severe enough to damage the esophagus. When accom- panied with esophageal erosion or ulcer, inhibitors of acid  secretion including proton-pump inhibitors and   $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  -recep- tor antagonists will treat patients with GERD (Castell et al.,  2002). Patients with a normal esophagus upon endoscopy are  described as having non-erosive reﬂ  ux disease (NERD). Only  60 to  $70\,\%$   of patients with NERD respond to a treatment with  suppressants of gastric secretion (Armstrong et al., 2004).  

While about 50 to   $60\,\%$   of patients with systemic sclerosis are  accompanied with GERD, these patients are often refractory to  the treatment with gastric acid suppressors (Inn et al., 2002).  

Ecabet  sodium  (ecabet),  a  gastric  protectant,  inhibits  pepsin  activity (Ito et al., 1993a), protects the gastric mucosal layer  in various types of stress conditions (Ito et al., 1993b; Ki- noshita et al., 1999a) and thus is used for the treatment of  gastiritis and gastric ulcers. In patients with systemic scle- rosis complicated by GERD, adjunct therapy with ecabet  on the standard treatment improved the therapeutic efﬁ  cacy  to more than   $90\,\%$   (Inn et al., 2002). A previous study has  shown alleviation of gastric reﬂ  ux-induced esophageal lesion  by ecabet in rats (Omura et al., 2000). In the present study we  have elucidated the detailed mechanism of this protection.  

# Methods  

# 1. Animals and materials  

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles-River Japan at  6 weeks of age, kept in controlled conditions with room temperature of   $23\pm1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  , relative humidity of  $55\pm5\,\%$   and 12-h light/dark cycles (light  from   $7{\cdot}00\;\mathrm{a.m.}$  . to  $7{\cdot}00\,\mathrm{p.m.}$  ) and freely accessible to water and chow for  1 week. The animals   $(190{-}250\,\mathrm{g})$  ) were fasted for  $24\,\mathrm{h}$   before the experi- ment. Ecabet, omeprazole, ranitidine and teprenone were synthesized  and rebamipide was extracted in Tanabe Seiyaku. For in vivo studies,  the compounds were prepared in   $0.25\,\%$   carboxymethyl cellulose  sodium salt to administer as 1 mL/kg and 2 mL/kg for intragastric and intra- duodenal injections, respectively. For in vitro studies, ecabet sodium  was dissolved in  $0.2\,\%$   NaCl containing  $0.1\,\mathrm{N\,HCl}$   and  $1\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$   pepsin  (Sigma No P6887, 3640 units/mg protein).

glandular stomach were ligated. Either ecabet or vehicle was injected  into the stomach and the abdomen was sutured.  

Rats were euthanized under deep anesthesia with ether   $4\,\mathrm{h}$   after sur- gery and the  $5\,\mathrm{cm}$   long esophagus and the whole stomach were removed.  The esophagus was cut along with the longitudinal axis and the length  of the hemorrhagic erosion was measured. Then the tissues were stored  frozen at  $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and used for the determination of mucosalbound ecabet  by HPLC. Gastric contents were centrifuged at   $1{,}500\times\mathrm{g}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  and the acid concentration and pepsin activity in supernatant, i. e. gastric  juice, were determined. Acid concentration was determined by a titrator   $\upmu\mathrm{Eq/mL}$  . The pepsin ac- tivity was determined with hemoglobin as a substrate and was expressed  as mg tyrosine  $/\mathrm{mL}/10\,\mathrm{min}$   (Anson, 1938).  

The content of mucus was determined as the amount of alcian blue  bound on the mucosal layer (Corne et al., 1974). One and   $2\,\mathrm{h}$   after the  ligation, the esophagus was removed, gently everted without damaging  the mucosal layer, washed with ice-cold saline and immersed in  $0.16\,\mathrm{M}$  sucrose-  $\mathrm{0.05\,M}$   Na acetate buffer   $(\mathrm{pH}=5.8)$  ) containing  $0.1\,\%$   alcian blue  for  $_{2\mathrm{h}}$   in room temperature. Then the tissue was rinsed in  $0.25\,\mathrm{M}$   sucrose  and sonicated in   $0.5\,\mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$   for   $30\,\mathrm{s}$  . The alcian blue concentration  in the solution was determined at   $579\,\mathrm{nm}$   by a spectrophotometer. The  esophagus of some animals were dissected  $^{4\mathrm{h}}$   after the ligation, ﬁ  xed  in buffered   $10\,\%$   formalin, dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁ  n. Thin  sections were stained with hematoxyline-eosine and examined under a  light microscope.  

Ecabet was administered directly into the stomach at 3, 10 and   $20\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  . Omeprazole at 3 and   $10\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  , ranitidine, rabamipide and  teprenone at  $100\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  , respectively, were given into the duodenum.  

# 3.   Effect on digestion of mucus in isolated and  everted esophagus sac  

Rats were euthanized under deep anesthesia with ether and the esopha- gus of   $5\,\mathrm{cm}$   long was isolated. Connective tissues were removed and  the wet weight was measured. The esophagus was then everted, ligated  with the both ends and digested in  $0.2\,\%$   NaCl containing  $0.1\,\mathrm{N}\,\mathrm{HCl}$   and   $1\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$   pepsin at  $37\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . Ecabet was included in the solution  at concentrations of 0.3, 1 and   $3\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$  . Some tissues were incubated  in   $0.2\,\%$   NaCl and served as non-digested tissues. After the digestion,  the esophagus was rinsed in ice-cold saline and stored in  $-20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The  amount of bound ecabet was determined by an HPLC method. The  incubated solution was treated with the same volume of  $7\,\%$   trichloro- acetic acid and centrifuged at   $1{,}500\times\mathrm{g}$   for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . The peptide content  in supernatant was determined with tyrosine as a standard (Folin and  Ciocalteau, 1927). The values under the detection limit were treated as 0  in the calculation. In other tissues, the mucus content was determined as  the amount of bound alcian blue.  

# 4. Analysis  

Results were expressed as the means   $\pm\mathrm{S.E.M}$  . Statistical analysis was  made by a  $t$  -test for comparison of 2 groups and one way analysis of  variance followed by the Bonferroni’s method for multiple groups. P  values  ${<}0.05$   were considered as statistically signiﬁ  cant.

Four hours after the ligation, the stomach and esophagus were ex- cised. The effects of ecabet on the length of hemorrhagic erosions, acid  concentration and pepsin activity in the gastric juice and the amount  of bound ecabet on the mucosal layer are shown.  Data are the mean   $\pm\:S.\mathrm{E.M}$   of 7 to 9 animals.  Signiﬁ  cantly different from control \*:  $\mathrm{p\!<\!0.05}$  ,   $^{**}$  :  $\mathrm{P}\!<\!0.01$  .  

pressed the formation of the erosions at 3, 10 and   $30\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  (Fig. 1). There was a statistical signiﬁ  cance at doses over   $10\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$  . While the acid concentration was not affected,  the pepsin activity was decreased and there was a binding  of ecabet on mucosal layers. The pathological examination  revealed extensive hemorrhages and necrosis not only in the  mucosal epithelium but also submucosa and muscle layers  in control animals   $4\mathrm{h}$   after the ligation (Fig. 2). In tissues  treated with ecabet, there was only a slight thinning of the  corniﬁ  ed layer and reduced staining.  

Omeprazole   $(10\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   and ranitidine   $(100\,\mathrm{mg/kg})$   signi- ﬁ  cantly reduced the acid concentration and the formation of  mucosal lesions (Fig. 3). Rebamipide and teprenone both at   $100\,\mathrm{mg/kg}$   neither affected the acid concentration and pepsin  activity and nor inhibited the lesion formation.

Under anesthesia with ether, fore-stomach and pylorus were ligated.  Omeprazole   $(\mathrm{Omz~10~mag}/\mathrm{kg})$  ), ranitidine (Ran,  $100\;\mathrm{mg/kg}$  ), rebamipide  (Reb,   $100~\mathrm{mg/kg}$  ) and teprenone (Tep,   $100~\mathrm{mg/kg}$   were administered  into duodenum.  Four hrs later both the stomach and esophagus were  dissected.  The length of hemorrhagic lesions, acid concentration and  pepsin activity in gastric juice were determined.

Figure 5 shows the esophageal mucus contents 1 and  $_{2\mathrm{h}}$  following the ligation. The mucus contents signiﬁ  cantly re- duced in 1 h and decreased to   $18\,\%$   of the normal level in  $_{2\mathrm{h}}$  Because of the formation of hemorrhagic lesions, the bind- ing of alcian blue was not determined after  $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$  . Both omepra- zole and ecabet signiﬁ  cantly prevented the reduction amount  of mucus.

Effects of ecabet   $(20\ \mathrm{mg/kg\ i.\,g.}$  ) and omeprazole   $.10~\mathrm{mg/}$   $\mathrm{kg\i.d.}$  ) were determined on the length of hemorrhagic erosions, acid  concentration and pepsin activity in the gastric juice.

# 3.   Effect of ecabet on the digestion of isolated esophagus  by pepsin and HCl  

Artiﬁ  cial gastric juice containing pepsin and HCl digested  mucosal layer of the isolated and everted esophagus sac were  incubated. The amount of released peptide in the incubat- ing solution increased to  $734\pm72.4\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$   tyrosine/g wet weight  (Fig. 6) and the content of remaining mucus decreased to   $33\,\%$   by incubation with acid and pepsin. Ecabet dose-de- pendently inhibited both the release of peptide and the re- maining mucus content on the everted sac at doses over 0.3  and  $1\,\mathrm{mg/mL}$  , respectively. In parallel to the inhibition of di- gestion by artiﬁ  cial gastric juice, the amount of ecabet bound  on the mucosa was increased dose-dependently.

4. Combination treatment of ecabet with acid suppressants  

Table 1 shows the effect of ecabet in combination with  omeprazole or ranitidine on esophageal lesions induced by  ligation. Hemorrhagic lesions,   $40\,\mathrm{mm}$   or more in control  animals, were reduced by about   $40\,\%$   with either treatment  alone. Combined treatment of ecabet with omeprazole or  ranitidine enhanced the inhibitory effect of each treatment.  The formation of erosion was reduced to about   $6~\mathrm{mm}$   or by   $85\,\%$   of the control level. The suppression of pepsin activity  by ecabet was not changed while the amount of bound ecabet  to mucosa was tended to decrease by omeprazole and rani- tidine. Ecabet did not affect the reduction of acid concentra- tion by omeprazole and ranitidine.

# Discussion  

Ligation of pylorus and fore-stomach induces reﬂ  ux of gastric  juice into the esophagus and thus forms lesions in the  esophageal mucosa in rats. In the present study, hemorrhag- ic and necrotic lesions were extensively induced within  $4\,\mathrm{h}$  following the ligation in all animals. The mucus contents  were profoundly reduced with no hemorrhagic lesions  $_{2\mathrm{h}}$   af- ter the ligation. This indicates that the mucus reduction pre- cedes the formation of erosion. A previous study has repor- ted that the removal of salivary glands extensively reduces  mucus contents and aggravates reﬂ  ux-induced lesion forma- tion (Kinoshita et al., 1999b). Therefore sufﬁ  cient supply of  mucus seems to be essential in preventing the esophageal  lesions by reﬂ  ux of gastric juice.  

Ecabet counteracts the digestion of mucus contents by  not only inhibiting the pepsin activity (Ito et al., 1993a) but also  by  forming  a  pepsin-resistant  complex  with  albumin,  ﬁ  brinogen  and mucin (Ito et al., 1993b) and this mechanism underlies  the protection of the mucosal layer and epithelium in the  stomach. In the present study, treatment with ecabet reduced  both the pepsin activity in gastric juice and the decrease  of mucus content from the early phase of lesion formation  following acute gastric reﬂ  ux. The effect was maintained up  to  $4\mathrm{h}$   and the formation of hemorrhagic erosion was substan- tially inhibited in the esophagus. Digestion of esophageal  mucus by artiﬁ  cial gastric juice in vitro was also inhibited  by ecabet depending on the amount bound to the mucosa.  The results thus indicate that ecabet preserves the integrity  of the mucosal layer in esophagus by an effect on mucus  contents as well as pepsin activity. The binding of ecabet to  mucus may contribute to the protection of the mucosal layer.  The  mechanism  distinct from inhibitors of gastric secretion  conﬁ  rms the potential of ecabet as a novel therapeutic for  GERD.  

Omeprazole and ranitidine, both inhibitors of gastric  secretion, reduced acid concentration without effect on  pepsin activity, and inhibited the hemorrhagic lesions in the  esophagus induced by ligation of the stomach. Suppression  of acid secretion explains well the clinical efﬁ  cacy of acid  suppressants in the treatment of GERD. In patients with re- fractory GERD, more than   $90\,\%$   recovery was reported by  ecabet in combination with the standard treatment (Inn et al.,  2002). In the present study, ecabet signiﬁ  cantly enhanced the  inhibitory effect of omeprazole and ranitidine on ligation-in- duced lesion formation. Inhibition of pepsin activity by eca- bet and suppression of gastric secretion by omeprazole and  ranitidine did not affect each other. While gastric acid alone  digests esophageal mucosa, the combination of pepsin and  acid aggravates the lesion formation (Goldberg et al., 1969;  Lillemoe et al., 1982; Lanas et al., 1997). Thus the enhanced  protection by combination of ecabet and inhibitors of gastric  secretion may be explained by additive coordinated action  on pepsin activity and acid secretion. This implies that eca- bet has potential as an adjunct for treatment of patients with  GERD, especially refractory to inhibitors of acid secretion.  

In conclusion, ecabet dose-dependently inhibited the  formation of esophageal lesions induced by reﬂ  ux of gastric  juice in rats. Both inhibition of pepsin activity and protection  of mucus from digestion by direct binding contribute to pres- ervation of the mucosal layer. Combination of ecabet with an  inhibitor of gastric secretion, i. e. omeprazole and ranitidine,  further enhanced the inhibition of lesion formation. This  demonstrates the potential of ecabet as a novel therapeutic  for GERD and as an adjunct to the treatment of refractory  GERD.
