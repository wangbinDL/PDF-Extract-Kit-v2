ABSTRACT.Thedose-response relationship between tobacco consumption and melanin pigmentation in the attach edging iv a was examined on two occasions 4 yr apart in a group of Japanese lead workers with blood lead concentrations below  $\mathbf{2.0\,\mu m o l/k g\,(40\,\mu g/100\,g)}$  In the two examinations,  $\mathbf{12\%}$  and  ${\bf\Pi}^{18\%}$  of the total group of workers and  $17\%$  and  $\bf{24\%}$  of the smokers had melanin pigmentation.The prevalence of pigmentation was significantly higherinsmokerswhoinhaledmorethan10cigarettesperday  $(17\%$  and  $\bf{25\%}$  ）thanin nonsmokers  $({\bf0}\%$  and  $\scriptstyle2\%$  ,and tended to increase significantly with tobacco cons ump- tion.Leadabsorption,however,was not associated with melanin pigmentation.  

MELANIN PIC MENT ATION in the attach edging iv a among tobacco smokers，i.e.，'smokers'melanosis,' was first described in white Europeans by Hedin,'and was noted among Japanese by one of the present authors.²Histologically,inthiscondition，melaninis deposited in the basal layer of the epithelium without evidence of malignancy.  

Pigmentation of the g in giv a is often found among AmericanNegroes,blackAfricans,nativeAustralians,and Greenland Eskimos.6 Heavy metal intoxication (e.g.,"classical lead poisoning),Yushodisease(PCB poisoning)，and some serious systemic illnesses also can cause various types of gingival pigmentation.7.8  

AmongJapanese,it was reported in 1928 that  $32\%$  of the people who visited or were admitted to hospitals had pigmentation of the oral mucosa and that  $56\%$  of those with the pigmentation were smokers;another Japanese report noted that the prevalence of pigment a- tionwas  $5\%$  1Accordingtoarecentstudy,62of94 cases of malignant melanoma in the oral cavity were associated with pigmentation of the g in giv a and other oralmucosa.'1 It should be especially noted that 34 cases were preceded by the pigmentation,towhichthe  

Inthisstudy,weevaluateadose-response relation ship between tobacco consumption and the g in giv al pigmentation in a group of Japanese lead workers. Evaluation of these workers was conducted twice at 4-yrintervals,during which blood lead concentrations decreased among the workers owing to the improve ment in their working environments.  

# SUBJECTS AND METHODS  

Allsubjects  $.N\;\;=\;\;195)$  were male lead workers (stereotype and type founders,type-pickers,typeset- ters，and papermolders)，who were constantly employed in a newspaper company for a total of 8 yr (i.e.,1972-1979).Aperiodic statutory medical ex- ami nation was commenced in 1972 in this company with measurements of blood lead concentrations and other indicators of lead absorption.'Concerted efforts to reduce environmental lead exposure were intro duc ed at workplaces in 1973;that effort was followed by a gradual decrease in workers'blood lead con cent ra- tions.  

Examination of melanin pigmentation in the attached gingiva,together with collection of data on tobacco consumption and blood lead concentrations,wascon- duct ed at the annual medical examinations in April of 1975and1979.Reliable data were obtained from a total of 154 and 165 workers  $(79\%$  and  $85\%$  ,respec- tively)eachyear.They had suffered from neither heavy metal poisoning no rYu sho disease.  

The presence of melanin pigmentation in the attached g in giv a of the mandible and maxilla on the labial side of the canines and incisors was assessed each year by two of the present authors.Any solitary or diffuse brownish black pigmentation within the epithelium of the attached gingiva,which corresponded to degrees I-iVofpig ment ation in Hedin'sclassification,wascountedas pigmentation.Figure 1 a shows diffuse pigmentation in front of the canines and incisors,both in the mandible andmaxilla,ina36-yr-old lead worker who smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 18 yr.Histologically,deposition ofmelaninpigmentwasobservedinthebasallayerof theepithelium;nolead sulfide was detected(Fig.1b).  

Blood lead concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry(Perkin-Elmer403)with wetashing,ch elation by ammonium pyr ro lid in edit hio- carbamate,andwater-saturated methyl iso but y ketone.13Normal'blood lead concentrations in this company are assumed to be  $0.4\,\pm\,0.1$  (mean  $\pm$  stan- darddeviation)  $\mu\mathsf{m o l}/\mathsf{k g}\;(8\,\pm\,2\,\mu\mathsf{g}/100\,\mathsf{g})$  .12  

Fisher's exact test was applied for the comparison of two proportions when an observed count(numberof persons)was five or less in one or more categories.The chi-squaretestwasusedwhentheobservedcountwas more than five in all categories.  

# RESULTS  

The prevalence of g in giv al pigmentation in 1975 is shown in Table 1 in relation to tobacco consumption history and blood lead concentrations.Among154 workersexamined,19  $(12\%)$  werefoundtohave melanin pigmentation in the attach edging iv a.The number of workers with pigmentation corresponded to

tionandprevalenceofgingivalpigmentation.Evidence for a causal relationship between tobacco smoking and pigmentationisstrengthenedbythisstudy  

The pigmentation rate was significantly higher in smokerswhosmokedmorethan10cigarettesperday than in nonsmokers;the average duration of smoking wasmorethan14yr(Table1).Analysesoftheeffectof smoking duration on the pigmentation rate and on its r ever sibi lit y would be required to determine more precisely the dose-response relationship  

The following findings indicate that leadabsorption does not cause melanin pigmentation in the attached g in giv a below the blood lead concentration of 2.0

  $\bar{\mu}\mathsf{m o l}/\mathsf{k g}$   $(40\;\mu{\bf g}/100\;{\bf g})

$  

（1）Nosignificantdifferenceinthepigmentationratewas found between the three blood lead level sex- amined.

 (2）The pigmentation rate remained unchanged in spite of a decrease in blood lead concentrations over 4 yr of observation.Infact,the rate minimally, thoughnot significantly,increased during this period,probably because most smokers continued to smoke during the period.

 (3)Macroscopic(andmicroscopic)findingsinthe pigment edging iv a did not coincide with those typical of the lead line in"classical'leadpoison- ing.Thelead line can be observed alongthemargin of the g in giv a and is characterized by distribution of lead sulfide granules in the bloodvessel walls and the connective tissue papillae.14  

The pigmentation rate among the Japanese in this study was close to that reported previously among white Europeans in Sweden  $13\%$  and  $15\%.$  . Therefore,it issuggested that no substantial racial dif- ference exists between Japanese and Europeans in the pigmentationrate.Therateisassumedtobedeter- mined by smoking rates.  

A possible effect of nicotine on the melanin-contain- ing cells in the g in giv a，as well as in the inner ear,has been suggested to be the cause of'smokers melanosis.'Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the development of this type of melanosis.Similarly,follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether this apparently benign mel anos is candevelopintomalignantmelanomaorotheroral malignancy.
