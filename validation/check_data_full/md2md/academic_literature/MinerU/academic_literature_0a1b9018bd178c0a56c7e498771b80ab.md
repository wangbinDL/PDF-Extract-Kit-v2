Abstract —The microstructure and electrical conductivity of micro crystalline and granular M–Ge   $\mathbf{M}\,{=}\,\mathbf{A}\mathbf{l}$  , Sc, Y) ﬁlms are studied. The results demonstrate that annealing of amorphous ﬁlms gives rise to microstructural changes and inﬂuences the temperature ranges of different conduction mechanisms. The electrical properties of micro crystalline and granular ﬁlms are compared.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Aluminum and rare-earth (RE) germanides are ideal materials for the preparation of micro crystalline and granular alloys. The key features of the interaction between the components of such alloys manifest them- selves in the structure of thin-ﬁlm materials [1–3]. The possibility of depositing amorphous germanium and micro crystalline metallic inclusions allows one to tune the physical properties of deposits over a broad range.  

The subject of this paper is the effect of annealing time and temperature on the microstructure and proper- ties of micro crystalline and granular M–Ge (  $({\bar{\mathbf{M}}}={\bar{\mathbf{Al}}}$  , Sc, Y) ﬁlms of different compositions. The hop distance and the density of localized states in the ﬁlms are cal- culated as a function of deposition conditions.  

# EXPERIMENTAL  

Granular and micro crystalline ﬁlms were produced by thermal coevaporation in a vacuum of   $10^{-3}$   Pa. As source materials, we used semiconductor-grade germa- nium, electrolytic aluminum, and extrapure-grade yttrium and scandium. The ﬁlms were grown on glass- ceramic substrates at room temperature. The deposition rate was varied from 2 to   $10~\mathrm{\bar{nm}/s}$  . Amorphous ﬁlms were heated in vacuum to   $500–520\mathrm{~K~}$   and held there until microcrystals appeared (about   $15\;\mathrm{\min}$  ). Film thickness,   = 100–200 nm, was determined using an MII-4 micro interferometer. Microstructures were examined on a UEMV-100K electron microscope. The temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the amorphous and annealed ﬁlms was measured in a helium cryostat in 5- to 10-K steps using a Shch34 mul- timeter.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

The volume fraction of crystalline phases in the ﬁlms was determined by electron microscopy. After annealing of the amorphous ﬁlms at 500–520 K for  $15\;\mathrm{{min}}$  , the content of the crystalline phase was   $^{20-}$   $25\%$   in the RE–Ge ﬁlms and   $10–15\%$   in the Al–Ge ﬁlms (Fig. 1). In an earlier study [4], the content of the crystalline phase in 27 wt  $\%$   $\ensuremath{\mathrm{Sc}}\,\dot{+}\,27$   wt  $\%$   $\mathrm{Fe+Ge}$   ﬁlms annealed at   $650\,\mathrm{~K~}$   was determined to be   $5{-}7\%$  . The annealed M–Ge deposits were found to contain metal microcrystals. Crystal growth ceased when a metasta- ble equilibrium between the crystalline and amorphous phases was reached. The structure and size of the microcrystals depended primarily on the metallic com- ponent of the alloys. In the RE–Ge deposits, the RE crystallites were distributed at random over the amor- phous matrix, and their maximum size did not exceed  $\stackrel{\_}{\simeq}0.26\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  m (Fig. 1a). The Al crystallites in the annealed granular Al–Ge deposits were about   $0.1~\upmu\mathrm{m}$  m in size (Fig. 1b). Amorphous ternary Ge-based alloys pro- duced by evaporation of separate sources offer a higher thermal stability and lower densities of microcrystals (Fig. 1c, 1d) [4, 5] compared to the M–Ge alloys. The crystallites in the ternary amorphous matrix were found to consist of   $\mathrm{ScFeGe}_{2}$  ,   $\mathrm{{Sc}_{4}\mathrm{{Fe}_{4}\mathrm{{Ge}_{6.6}}}}$  , and  ${\mathrm{FeGe}}_{2}$  .  

At low temperatures, the electrical conductivity of the micro crystalline RE–Ge deposits varies smoothly, without breaks. Characteristically, the ﬁlms have a neg- ative temperature coefﬁcient of resistance. This behav- ior ﬁts well with the Mott–Davis theory of amorphous materials with allowance made for three conduction mechanisms: thermally activated conduction, hopping transport through localized states at band edges, and hopping transport through localized states near the Fermi level (Fig. 2). Annealing slightly increases the low-temperature conductivity and shifts the break in the Arrhenius plot to higher temperatures, which is related to changes in transport properties.  

The conductivity of the granular Al–Ge ﬁlms exhib- its Arrhenius behavior, in contrast to that of the micro- crystalline RE–Ge deposits (Fig. 2). Compositional variations in the range 62–66 wt  $\%$   Al have little effect on the conductivity of the Al–Ge ﬁlms (Fig. 3).

Using techniques described in [6, 7], we analyzed the conductivity versus temperature data for the ﬁlms studied here with the aim of determining some param- eters of low-temperature electrical transport processes. From the plots of   $\ln(\upsigma T^{1/2})$   versus   $T^{-1/4}$   (Fig. 4), we evaluated  $\upsigma_{0}$   and   $T_{0}$   in the Mott formula  

$$
\upsigma\,=\,\upsigma_{0}T^{-1/2}{\exp}\biggl(-\frac{T_{0}}{T}\biggr)^{1/4},
$$  

$$
T_{0}=\frac{18\alpha^{3}}{N(E_{\mathrm{F}})k}\,\,\,\mathrm{and}\,\,{\upsigma}_{0}=3e^{2}\upgamma_{\mathrm{ph}}\bigg(\frac{N(E_{\mathrm{F}})}{288\uppi\upalpha k}\bigg)^{1/2}\,.
$$  

This allowed us to estimate the low-temperature hop distance   $R=\left(\frac{9}{8\pi N(E_{\mathrm{F}})\upalpha k T}\right)^{1/4}$  , the transfer energy  $W={\frac{3}{8\pi R^{3}N(E_{\mathrm{{F}}})}}$  , and the Fermi-level density of local- ized states   $N(E_{\mathrm{F}})=4.29\times10^{50}T_{\mathrm{0}}^{1/2}\frac{\upsigma_{0}^{3}}{\upgamma_{\mathrm{ph}}^{3}}$  , where   $\Upsilon_{\mathrm{ph}}$   is the frequency factor (  $(\upgamma_{\mathrm{ph}}=10^{13})$  ),   $\upalpha$   is the damping constant of the wave function of localized states at the Fermi level   $(\upalpha=10^{-7}\;\mathrm{cm})$   cm), and   $k$   is the Boltzmann constant  $(k\,{=}\,8.16\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{eV/K})$   eV/K) [7].  

In 25 wt  $\%$   $\mathrm{Sc}+25$   wt  $\%$   $\mathrm{,\,Fe+Ge}$   ﬁlms, the conduc- tion mechanism changes from carrier transport through delocalized states to transport through localized states at band edges between 150 and   $120\,\mathrm{K}$  . In the range  $58-$   $47\ \mathrm{~K~}$  , a gradual transition to hopping conduction occurs. The transition to variable range hopping takes place in a very narrow temperature range, between 14 and   $11\,\mathrm{~K~}$  , independent of the thermal history of the

Changes in the Fermi-level density of localized states, hop distance, and transfer energy inﬂuence the parameters of low-temperature carrier transport. In the

micro crystalline materials prepared by annealing amor- phous deposits, the temperature ranges of different con- duction mechanisms vary insigniﬁcantly. This ﬁnding is somewhat surprising since, according to earlier results, increasing the carrier mobility and the density of states related to structural defects at the Fermi level accelerates the transition from carrier transport through delocalized states to transport through localized states at the Fermi level [8]. Note that annealing increases the density of structural defects and dangling bonds in amorphous materials and gives rise to structural order- ing, which results in speciﬁc microstructures and prop- erties of the resulting ﬁlms, consisting of nanocrystal- line or granular alloys [9, 10].  

Annealing also inﬂuences the parameters of carrier transport in the amorphous Al–Ge deposits. As in the case of RE–Ge ﬁlms, the effect is stronger for ﬁlms grown in electric or magnetic ﬁelds [11, 12]. The trans- port parameters are governed by the even distribution of the metallic inclusions, even though their density in the amorphous matrix is rather low.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The present results on the microstructure and elec- trical properties of micro crystalline and granular ﬁlms indicate that p recrystallization annealing allows one to produce materials containing metallic nanoparticles embedded in an amorphous semiconductor matrix. The mechanism of micro crystal lite nucleation depends on the nature of the components of the alloy, annealing conditions, and deposition procedure. The electrical conductivity of the ﬁlms is determined by the proper- ties of the amorphous matrix, which undergoes struc- tural changes on heating. The annealing-induced changes in the microstructure and properties of micro- crystalline ﬁlms are more signiﬁcant than those in gran- ular ﬁlms.
