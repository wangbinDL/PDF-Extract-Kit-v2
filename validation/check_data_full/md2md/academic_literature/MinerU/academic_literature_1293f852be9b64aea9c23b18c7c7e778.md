# Abstract  

# Background  

Plasma cardiac troponin   $(\mathrm{cTn})$   elevation occurs in acute ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage and can suggest a poor prognosis. Because acute cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) might lead to venous stasis, which could result in cardiac stress, it is important to evaluate whether cTn elevation occurs in patients with CVT.  

# Methods  

Inpatients at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2005 to 2015 meeting the following criteria were included: CVT ( ICD-9  codes with ra- diologic con ﬁ rmation) and available admission electrocardiogram (ECG) and cTn level. In regression models, presence of ECG

abnormalities and cTn elevation   $(>\!0.06\ \mathrm{ng/mL})$  ) were evaluated as dependent variables in separate models, with location and severity of CVT involvement as independent variables, adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension.  

# Results  

$\operatorname{Of}81$   patients with CVST, 53   $\left(66\%\right)$   met the inclusion criteria. Participants were, on average, aged 42 years, white   $(71\%)$  , and female   $(66\%)$  . The left transverse sinus was most commonly thrombosed   $(47\%)$  , with   $66\%$   having   ${>}2$   veins thrombosed. Twenty-two   $(41\%)$   had cTn elevation. Odds of cTn elevation increased per each additional vein thrombosed (adjusted OR 2.79,  $95\%$   CI [1.08 – 7.23]). Of those with deep venous involvement,   $37.5\%$   had cTn elevation compared with   $4.4\%$   without deep clots   $\left(p=0.02\right)$  . Venous infarction   $\left(\mathsf{n}=15\right)$  ) was associated with a higher mean cTn (0.14 vs  $0.02\;\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL},\,p=0.009)$   and was predictive of a higher cTn in adjusted models (  ${\upbeta}=0.15$  ,  $95\%$   CI [0.06 – 0.25]).  

# Conclusions  

In this single-center cohort study, markers of CVT severity were associated with increased odds of cTn elevation; further investigation is needed to elucidate causality and signi ﬁ cance.  

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is distinct in the  ﬁ eld of cerebrovascular neurology, given its predilection for young adults with minimal comorbidity. The pathophysiology of brain injury from CVT is generally from (1) increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from impaired venous drainage resulting in neurologic dysfunction or (2) venous ischemia and/or hemor- rhage leading to focal brain parenchymal damage.   Venous stasis can lead to elevated ICP, venous infarct, or hemorrhage, suggesting that the 2 mechanisms are likely synergistic, but the

clinical de ﬁ cits resulting from either mechanism can lie along a spectrum ranging from mild disease to profound morbidity.  

There is increasing recognition and research regarding the importance of the heart-brain axis in stroke prognosis. Patients with arterial ischemic stroke with elevated plasma cardiac troponin   $\left(\mathrm{cTn}\right)$  , compared with those without ele- vated cTn, have increased mortality,   as do those with in- tracranial hemorrhage, independent of hemorrhage volume, sex, and age.   In-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) changes portend a poorer prognosis for both stroke types.   Single measures of cTn are associated with incident venous thromboembolism,   but whether such changes are seen in patients with CVT is unknown. As cTn is a marker of cardiac injury, it is plausible that turbulent and impaired venous  ﬂ ow occurring in more severe CVT cases, such as those with higher degrees of clot burden, would have elevated cTn. The aim of this study is to describe possible cardiac changes, speci ﬁ cally ECG characteristics and cTn levels, seen in patients with CVT. We hypothesize that more severe fea- tures of CVT will be associated with abnormal ECG  ﬁ ndings or cTn elevation.  

# Methods  

# Study population  

Study inclusion criteria were admission to Johns Hopkins Hospital during a 10-year period (2005 – 2015) with a di- agnosis of CVT ( ICD-9 : 325, 437.6) con ﬁ rmed by in- patient cerebral imaging, with an available inpatient ECG and cTn drawn during the hospitalization. ECG is standard of care, but cTn was measured at the discretion of the clinical team. Cerebral imaging used to con ﬁ rm diagnosis was either cerebral tomography angiography or MR angi- ography. The presence of venous infarction and venous hemorrhage was determined using radiology reports. Age was de ﬁ ned in years at the time of admission. Race and ethnicity were self-reported at the time of admission. Hypertension was de ﬁ ned as a medical history of hyper- tension. The study was single centered to enable consis- tent methodology.  

# ECG measures  

The following continuous ECG variables were collected: QT interval (ms), QRS duration (ms), ventricular rate (bpm), atrial rate (bpm), P axis (degrees), and R axis (degrees). The presence or absence of T-wave inversion, ST elevation, U waves, Q waves, premature ventricular contractions, pre- mature atrial contractions, right bundle branch block, and/ or left bundle branch block was also determined. These variables were collected, by an investigator masked to CVT characteristics, from the clinical reports from during the inpatient hospitalization, with additional direct review and con ﬁ rmation of the ECG tracings by the study physi- cian (M.C.J.).  

# Cardiac troponin  

cTn was drawn during the inpatient stay, with the level measured by the Johns Hopkins clinical laboratory. Levels were recorded continuously and a positive cTn de ﬁ ned as  ${\geq}0.06~\mathrm{ng}/\mathrm{mL}$  .  

# CVT characteristics  

Imaging reports were reviewed masked to ECG data to determine the thrombus location and the individual clot count per patient. Speci ﬁ cally, the location of the venous clot was categorized as present or absent using the following designations: superior sagittal sinus, left transverse sinus (LTS), right transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, right sig- moid sinus, left internal jugular, right internal jugular, in- ferior sigmoid sinus, straight sinus (SS), cortical vein thrombosis (de ﬁ ned as clot in the vein of Labbe or Trolard), deep venous thrombosis (de ﬁ ned as clot in the medullary and/or subependymal veins), and cavernous sinus throm- bosis. A large thrombus extending from one venous struc- ture to the adjacent venous structure was counted as present in both structures. Imaging reports were reviewed to de- termine the presence or absence of insular stroke, venous infarction, and venous hemorrhage, each. If the patient had more than one imaging procedure performed during in- patient admission, the scan resulting in diagnosis (usually the  ﬁ rst) was the one considered for analysis and de ﬁ nition of CVT characteristics.  

# Covariates  

Demographics and risk factor data were obtained from the medical record. Demographics considered were race and sex and age at diagnosis of CVT. Risk factor data collected were based on the literature and included a documented (elec- tronic medical record) medical history of type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, coronary artery disease, atrial  ﬁ brillation, previous history of stroke, previous history of intracerebral hemorrhage, sickle cell disease, and oral contraceptive use at the time of CVT event.  

# Statistical analysis  

Categorical variables are reported as percentages, whereas continuous variables are reported as mean values. Two- sample  t  tests with equal variance and  $\chi^{2}$    method were used for univariable analysis for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate the associations between continuous ECG parameters (dependent variable) and markers of CVT severity (clot location, clot count, presence of thrombus in deep venous structures, insular stroke, venous hemorrhage, and venous infarct). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between dichotomous ECG parameters and markers of CVT se- verity. Similarly, regression models were used to estimate the associations between continuous cTn or dichotomous positive cTn (dependent variables) and markers of CVT severity. Regression models were then adjusted for age and sex (model 1) and additionally for hypertension (model 2). Given the small number of observations, only those demographics for which there was the highest sus- picion for confounding were included in the adjustment models.

# Results  

# Demographics  

Fifty-three patients met the inclusion criteria; they were predominantly white females who were middle aged at the time of CVT diagnosis (table 1). Patients had little cardiac comorbidity, with the most common risk factor being a his- tory of hypertension   $\left(26\%\right)$  . Seven patients   $\left(13\%\right)$   were using oral contraceptive pills at the time of diagnosis. The LTS was the most common location for thrombus   $(47\%)$  , with 10 patients having hemorrhage associated with the CVT and 8 having an insular stroke (table 1). ECG characteristics fell within the normal range with an average ventricular rate for patients of 78   $\left(\pm16.0\right)$   bpm at the time of ECG. Seven patients had evidence of T-wave inversion. Twenty-two patients had a positive troponin with the overall range of  $0.06{-}0.93~\mathrm{ng/mL}$   (table 1).

there was no di ﬀ erence in the mean troponin level among those with venous hemorrhage or insular stroke. Those with venous infarction   $\left(\mathsf{n}=15\right)$  ) had a higher mean cTn (0.14 vs 0.02,  $p\,=\,0.009\$  ) than did individuals without venous in- farction. Venous infarct was associated with a higher tro- ponin level among those of the same age, sex, and hypertension history (  $'\beta=0.15$  ,  $95\%$   CI [0.06 – 0.25]) (table 4). Of those with deep venous involvement (deep veins, SS;  $\mathfrak{n}\ =\ 8\$  ),   $37.5\%$   had cTn elevation compared with   $4.4\%$  without deep clots   $\left(p=0.02\right)$  . Patients with a higher number of thrombosed deep venous structures had a higher mean troponin in the  ﬁ nal adjusted model (  $\upbeta=0.10$   per additional thrombosed deep venous structure,  $95\%$   CI [0.01 – 0.19]); however, there was no association between the presence of thrombus (versus no thrombus) in any individual deep vein and a higher mean troponin. Those with an insular stroke had a higher troponin level compared with those without, but only after adjusting for age, sex, and hypertension his- tory (  $\upbeta=0.12$  ,  $95\%$   CI [0.00 – 0.24]). Those with a venous infarct or venous hemorrhage had approximately 20 times the odds of a positive troponin compared with those who did not have these CVT characteristics, but this estimate, while signi ﬁ cant, is imprecise. Odds of cTn elevation in- creased per each additional vein thrombosed (OR 2.79,  $95\%$  CI [1.08 – 7.23]).  

# Discussion  

Among patients admitted to an academic center with a di- agnosis of CVT, characteristics of more severe CVT such as venous infarction, venous hemorrhage, involvement of the deep venous structures, or increasing clot count were asso- ciated with an elevation of cTn.  

# ECG analysis  

There was no di ﬀ erence when comparing mean values or percentages of either the continuous or dichotomous ECG variables when considering these markers across patients with CVT with insular stroke, venous hemorrhage, or venous infarct. When considering the total clot count of patients with CVT, none of the ECG parameters were found to be signif- icantly associated in either univariable or adjusted models (age, sex, and hypertension) (tables 2 and 3).  

# cTn analysis  

Of the 53 participants, 22 met the criteria for cTn elevation  $(41\%)$  . When considering the continuous troponin level, The pathophysiology of CVT is unique and distinct and rec- ognized to be di ﬀ erent from that of arterial thrombosis. Vaso- genic edema occurs earlier in venous strokes than in arterial 7   strokes and is thought to be due to the early increase in venous pressure that occurs from venous occlusion. Continued increases in venous pressure lead to venous rupture, resulting in hemorrhage, or alternatively, progressive drops in cerebral perfusion pressure cross the ischemic threshold and result in strokes.  

Troponin elevation has been repeatedly described in strokes of all etiologies, with a meta-analysis suggesting an   $18\%$

overall prevalence.   Troponin release occurs in the setting of cardiac cell necrosis, and hence, it has a role in measuring myocardial ischemia.   However, a study involving patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and with a positive cTn and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram failed to demonstrate any abnormalities during coronary angio- gram, suggesting that myocardial ischemia alone is not su ﬃ cient to describe what leads to cTn elevation in these patients.  

Adequate venous return to the heart is pivotal for sustained 12   cardiac output and involves the careful balance of mean systemic pressure and right atrial pressure. Mean systemic pressure is a ﬀ ected by blood volume and vascular tone, with the sympathetic nervous system playing an important role in regulation of vascular tone. Cerebral venous drainage is complex with the assumption that increases in right arterial pressure are transmitted through the jugular venous channel, but how this relates to systemic venous return is not well described.   It is recognized that autor- egulatory mechanisms protect the brain from alterations in cerebral blood  ﬂ ow, but how much this model applies in the event of a disrupted blood-brain barrier, such as what can occur in CVT, is unknown. Imaging studies suggest that patients with CVT have alterations of venous hemo- dynamics with increased mean blood  ﬂ ow velocity and turbulence of venous  ﬂ ow in attempting to recruit venous collaterals.   It is possible that CVT through this altered turbulent venous return could result in either early myo- cyte necrosis or some degree of myocardial stretch resulting in a positive troponin.  

Our associations with cTn were the strongest among those with deep venous clots. Cerebral deep venous thrombosis is strongly associated with dysfunction of the diencephalon, which can manifest clinically with symptoms of decreased consciousness or other brain stem signs.   The presence of a clot in the deep venous system has been associated with an increased risk of death and dependency.   It is possible that our reported association represents not only a  ﬂ ow phe- nomenon but also a disruption to the diencephalon, which modulates the autonomic system and neurohormonal acti- vation and results in nonischemic myocyte necrosis.

of the brain have been suggested as one potential mechanism for cTn elevation in ischemic stroke and hemorrhage. Al- though the number of participants with insular stroke was low, we notably did not  ﬁ nd an association between insular involvement and odds of elevated cTn or the mean level of patients ’  cTn.  

We have postulated some of the mechanisms by which pos- itive cTn may be seen in CVT, but we recognize that there are limitations to this study. The small size of the cohort may limit our ability to draw conclusions. This study being ob- servational was conducted at a single center to have consis- tent methodology in terms of the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. The data presented are useful to generate hypotheses that will inform future research. A larger study is warranted to draw conclusions.

de ﬁ ne study parameters in patients with multiple tests over the duration of the admission. It may be that associations would change should later ECGs or imaging be used. The included patients were also a population in whom a troponin level was obtained at the discretion of the admission team, and this may introduce selection bias. As a result of the ret- rospective nature of this work, clinical neurologic de ﬁ cits as documented were not included, so this work is unable to speak to the relationship between clinical de ﬁ cits and cTn. Furthermore, because of the observational nature of this study, we cannot draw conclusions about causality, and it is likely that there are some residual confounders.  

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that among patients with acute CVT with more severe characteristics, there is an in- creased odds of cTn and that this increases per additional ve- nous structure involved and with deep venous involvement. Although the exact mechanism and clinical rami ﬁ cations ofsuch a  ﬁ nding remain to be elucidated, these associations may pos- sibly suggest alterations of  ﬂ ow dynamics that have a systemic e ﬀ ect.
