Summary   Reciprocal crosses between  Brassica carinata  (BBCC,  $2n{=}34$  ) and   $B$  . tournefortii  (TT,   $2n{=}20$  ) were attempted in order to determine crossability between the species, carry out chromo- somal associations among the B, C and T genomes, and to study morphology of the interspeciﬁc hy- brids. A hybrid between these 2 species was obtained only when   $B$  . carinata  was used as a female  parent. Morphologically, the hybrid was intermediate between the progenitor species but its leaves  resembled   $B$  . carinata . The   $\mathrm{F}_{1}$  plant was tall but grew very slowly. The hybrid was almost male     sterile, showing only   $2.3\%$   pollen stainability. Meiotic studies of trigenomic triploid hybrid (BCT,   $2n{=}27$  ) showed various chromosome conﬁgurations including quadrivalents (0–1), trivalents (0–2),  bivalents (2–9) and univalents (5–23). Only 5 univalents were recorded to have occurred; otherwise  trivalents and bivalents were observed in pollen mother cells of the BCT hybrid. A few chromo- somal association could be expected through allosyndesis which suggests the possibility of transfer- ring genes across the species through interspeciﬁc hybridization.

Ethiopian or Abyssinian mustard ( Brassica carinata  A. Braun,   $2n{=}34$  ) possesses many desir- able characteristics that are rare in the other  Brassica  oil crops: heat and drought tolerance, toler- ance to various biotic and abiotic stresses and availability of yellow-seeded germplasm (Jiang  et al. 2007). Inspite of these positive attributes, the crop suffers from many agronomic limitations like  longer crop duration, poor harvest index, low oil content  etc ., whereas   $B$  . tournefortii    $(2n{=}20)$  ),  known variously as wild turnip or Sahara mustard or Asian mustard or Tournefort ʼ s mustard or  Tournefort ʼ s Birdrape, grown sporadically in a few pockets of arid and semi-arid areas, has a strat- egy of early and quick growth because this effectively captures available soil moisture, enables it to  build a canopy, reproduce and mature before neighbouring species (Minnich and Sanders 2000). It  has also been reported as having a good source of tolerance against aphids (Singh  et al.  1965) and  drought (West and Nabhan 2002). However, lower test weight   $(2{-}3\,\mathrm{g}/1000$   seed) and susceptibility  to downy mildew (Rajpurohit and Choudhary 1995) are the major constraints in the spread of this  species.  

Interspeciﬁc hybridization has great potential for the improvement of  Brassica.  Besides the  transfer of useful traits across the species in genus  Brassica  (Roy 1984, Rahman 2001, Rygulla  et  al.  2007), such crosses were widely used to create genetic variability (Prakash 1973a), genetic  diversity (Choudhary and Joshi 2001) and to synthesize artiﬁcially new species such as  Brassicoraphanus  (Tokumasu 1970)  Brassica napocampestris  (McNaughton 1973) and  Raphanofortii  (Choudhary  et al.  2000a). Both  B. carinata  and   $B$  . tournefortii  species have their  own advantage and deﬁciencies. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to examine crossabil- ity between  $B$  . carinata  and  $B$  . tournefortii  and to observe the meiotic behaviour of the interspeciﬁc   $\mathrm{F_{1}}$   hybrid of these species as it suggests the possibility of genetic introgressions for crop improve- ments which take place through chromosomal interchange.  

# Materials and methods  

Two genotypes of  $B$  . tournefortii  (TT,  $2n{=}20$  )  —  RBT 58 and RBT 61  —  and 1 of  $B$  . carinata (BBCC,   $2n{=}34$  )  —  BCN selected from the germplasm collection of the Agricultural Research  Station, Mandor-Jodhpur, India were used in the hybridization programme.  

The reciprocal interspeciﬁc crosses were attempted involving the selected genotypes of both  the species under ﬁeld conditions. Emasculation and pollination were conducted as per the given  procedure. Immature ﬂower buds of appropriate size were emasculated by removal of anthers in the  evening and bagged with butter paper bags. In the following morning, stigma of these buds were  pollinated with pollen of the desired parent and the racemes were re-enclosed with bags to prevent  cross pollination. Seeds obtained from crosses and parents were grown in the ﬁeld for evaluation.  Morphological comparisons were made, and the meiosis of the interspeciﬁc hybrid was studied.  

For meiotic analysis, young ﬂower buds were ﬁxed in freshly prepared solution of propionic  acid: absolute ethanol   $(1:3)$   containing ferric chloride as a mordent. After   $24\,\mathrm{h}$   the rinsed ﬂower  buds were stored in   $70\%$   ethanol until slides were made by the acetocarmine   $(1\%)$   squash tech- nique. Chromosome associations were observed at diakinesis/metaphase I. Pollen fertility of the  hybrid and parents was estimated by pollen grain stainability in acetocarmine   $(1\%)$  .  

# Results  

# Crossability  

The seed setting was almost double in the cross  $B$  . carinata  $\times B$  . tournefortii  compared to its re- ciprocal combination. Out of 112 ﬂowers buds of   $B$  . carinata  pollinated with pollen of   $B$  . tourne- fortii , 22 seeds were obtained giving rise to only a single hybrid plant. On contrary, in the recipro- cal combination, out of 122 buds of   $B$  . tournefortii  pollinated by   $B$  . carinata  pollen, only 11 seeds  were obtained which did not yield any true hybrids.  

# Morphological features of  $\dot{\boldsymbol{F}}_{I}$   hybrids  

The phenotype of the hybrid was intermediate between parent species. The size and shape of  leaves of the hybrid were closer to  $B$  . carinata . They were obovate-lanceolate, petiolate, pinnatiﬁed  to pinnatipartite with entire to slightly dentate margin, obtuse tip, sparsely hairy and dark green in  colour. The ﬂowers were medium in size with pale yellow petals but their shape was similar to  $B$  tournefortii . The hybrid was tall but grew very slowly and took as many as  $95\,\mathrm{d}$   to ﬂower and   $168\,\mathrm{d}$  to mature completely (Table 1). The  $\mathrm{F_{1}}$   plant exhibited enhancement in values of attributes like pri- mary and secondary branches, main raceme length, siliquae on main raceme and siliquae per plant.  On the other hand, siliqua length, seeds per siliqua, seed weight and seed yield were recorded much  lower in the hybrid compared to either of the parents. Few seeds were set in the   $\mathrm{F}_{1}$   plant due to  open pollination. However, no seed set was found under self-pollination or in backcrosses.  

# Meiotic characteristics of  $\dot{\boldsymbol{F}}_{I}$   hybrids  

The chromosome associations observed in pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the trihaploid BCT  hybrid   $(2n{=}27)$  ) are given in Table 2 and some representative cells are shown in Figs. 1–3. A total of  59 PMCs of the hybrid were analyzed at diakinesis/metaphase I. At least 2 bivalents were observed  in all the PMCs, but the maximum of 9 bivalents were observed in   $17\%$   of cells (Fig. 2). Many of  them exhibited chiasmatic conﬁgurations (Fig. 2). Multivalents in the form of trivalents (0–2) and

quadrivalents (0–1) were also noticed in the  majority of PMCs   $(59.4\%)$  . Only 5 univalents  were observed in a single cell; the rest were tri- valents and bivalents. The mode of chromo- some association observed was   $2\,\mathrm{\III+7\II+7\I}

$   $(16.9\%)$  , 1   $\mathrm{III}{+7}$     $\mathrm{~II+10~\,~I~}$     $(13.6\%)$   9 II+9 I 

  $(11.9\%)$  ,   $1\,\mathrm{\III+8\II+8\I\ (8.5\%)}$   and   $^{7\,\mathrm{\scriptsize~II}+13\,\mathrm{\scriptsize~I}}

$   $(8.5\%)$  . On an average, each PMC had shown  an association of   $0.02{\scriptstyle\pm0.02}$     $\mathrm{IV+0.77\pm0.10~III+}$   $6.69{\pm}0.25\;\mathrm{II+11}.20{\pm}0.59\,\mathrm{I}$  .  

The stickiness and delayed terminalisation  of the chiasmata made it difﬁcult to determine  the exact nature of the chromosome association  observed (Fig. 4). Further, it was not always  possible to distinguish between the relatively  small bivalents of the B and T genome(s) and  the relatively large univalents of the C genome.  In the majority of the cases, well-deﬁned meta- phase plates could not be recognized as the bi- valents did not congress at the equatorial plate  but rather were distributed randomly through- out the cell. Bivalent and trivalent associations  were observed even at late anaphase I.  Distribution of chromosomes at anaphase (I/II)  was random due to unequal disjunction.  

Bridge-fragment conﬁgurations were observed in   $12.5\%$   of cells (Fig. 5). The majority of cells had  laggards at both anaphases I (Figs. 5, 6) and II. The complete process of meiosis was found to be ir- regular. Most of the cells did not divide synchronously; monads and dyads were observed in high  frequency. These meiotic irregularities might be the reason for pollen being mostly sterile. The per- centage of stainable pollen recorded in the hybrid was only  $2.3\%$  .

# Discussion  

The hybrid from cross  B .  carinata  $\times B$  .  tournefortii  was obtained only when    $B$  .  carinata  was  used as a female parent. This was not anticipated as in the majority of interspeciﬁc crosses reported  in  Brassica , there was greater success when the species with the higher basic chromosome number  was used as a female (Quazi 1988, Choudhary and Joshi 1999). Nishiyama  et al.  (1991) reported  that crosses between tetraploid and diploid species were partly successful, while the reciprocal,  i.e. diploid ⊗ tetraploid, usually failed. However, the occurrence of the hybrid in the direction of   $B$  .  carinata  $\times B$  .  tournefortii  in the present study is in contradiction to Harberd ʼ s theory that interspe- ciﬁc crosses with  $B$  .  tournefortii  were only possible when it was used as a female parent (Harberd  1976).  

The sexual hybrid   between  $B$  .  carinata  and  $B$  .  tournefortii  was reported for the ﬁrst time by us  (Joshi and Choudhary 1999). The hybrid plant was observed to be an intermediate in terms of many  phenotypic features of both the parents. This is an advantage, since it would allow better selection  for speciﬁc attributes in segregating progenies.  

Meiotic studies of trigenomic triploid hybrid BCT (  $2n{=}27$  ) revealed various chromosome con- ﬁgurations including quadrivalents (0–1), trivalents (0–2) and bivalents (2–9). Based on earlier  studies on haploid genomes of B (Prakash 1973b), C (Armstrong and Keller 1982) and T (Prakash  1974), a total of 7 bivalents were theoretically possible due to autosyndesis in these 3 genomes.  Hence, out of the maximum of 9 bivalents observed in the present hybrid, 2 could be expected to be  due to allosyndesis among the B, C and T genomes. Mizushima (1968) noticed a maximum of 3 bi- valents in a TC hybrid and opined that one of them might be due to allosyndesis between these 2  genomes, while Ljungberg  et al.  (1993) observed a maximum of   $1\ \mathrm{III}{+}3\ \mathrm{II}{+}10\ \mathrm{I}$   in a similar hybrid  and suggested the possibility of allosyndetic pairing in   $\mathrm{T}$   and C genomes. Narain and Prakash  (1972) reported a maximum of 3 bivalents in a BT hybrid but did not say anything regarding the  nature of origin of such bivalents. Sarla and Raut (1991) found a maximum of   $1\;\mathrm{III}{+}5\;\mathrm{II}{+}4\;\mathrm{I}$   in BC  hybrid and demonstrated homology between the B and C genomes. Pairing in the present triploid  hybrid has been assumed to occur mostly between the B and C genomes. However, less than 10  univalents (possibly of   $\mathrm{T}$   genome) were counted in   $45.8\%$   of all PMCs, suggesting that some T  chromosomes of   $B$  .  tournefortii  might have been involved in the pairing with B and C chromo- somes.  

The high level of pairing observed in the hybrid might be due to auto/allosyndesis pairing  within and among the genomes. This might be attributed to structural similarities and duplications  of some of the chromosomes (Röbbelen 1960). However, the heteromorphic appearance of biva- lents in some of the PMCs observed and the presence of only 5 univalents, instead of the 27 ex- pected, indicated the extent of homology among B, C and T genomes. Bridges at anaphase I ob- served in the present material might have resulted from pairing between partially chromosomes of  the parent genomes. Such inter-genomic pairing in  Brassica  hybrid was also observed by Howard  (1938). The occurrence of multivalent association at a high frequency in the hybrid studied indi- cated that parts of the chromosomes of these genomes possess sufﬁcient afﬁnity to allow multiva- lent association (Newell  et al.  1984). This showed that some of chromosomes of these 3 genomes  had duplicate archetypes and conﬁrmed the hypothesis of the secondary polyploidy origin of the B,  C and T genomes. Secondly, the lower average chromosome association observed in the present  BCT hybrid, compared to that reported in an ABC hybrid by Choudhary  et al.  (2000b), suggested  that the T genome was more distantly related than A to both the B and C genomes. Inter-genomic  chromosome associations noticed in the hybrid indicated the possibility of transferring genes across  the species through interspeciﬁc hybridization.
