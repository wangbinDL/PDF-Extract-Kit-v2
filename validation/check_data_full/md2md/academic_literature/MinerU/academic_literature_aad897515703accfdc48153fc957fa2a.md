# Committee Opinion No. 723: Guidelines for Diagnostic Imaging During Pregnancy and Lactation: Correction  

In  “ Committee Opinion No. 723: Guidelines for Diagnostic Imaging During Pregnancy and Lacta- tion ”  from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,   there is an error on page e211 in the sentence on line 13 of the  “ Ultrasonogra- phy ”  section of the document. The text incorrectly reads,    $^{\llangle}2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\:(35.6^{\circ}\mathrm{F})^{\backprime}$   and should instead read,    $\ {^\backprime}2{^\circ}{\dot{\mathrm{C}}}

$   $\left(3.6^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  . ”  The full, corrected sentence is as follows:

 “ At this intensity, the theoretical increase in tem- perature elevation for the fetus may be as high as

  $\mathrm{\Dot{2}^{\circ}C}$     $\left(3.6^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$   (2, 3). ”
