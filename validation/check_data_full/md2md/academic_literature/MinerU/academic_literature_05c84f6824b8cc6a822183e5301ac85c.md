We describe a case of coronary artery perforation in a 76-year-old man, successfully treated by tris-acryl gelatin microsphere embolisation. This novel interventional embolic material is used in interventional radiology for arterial embolisation. We believe that this is the ﬁrst report of its use for a coronary artery perforation.

# Introduction  

Coronary artery perforation during percutaneous inter- ventions is relatively rare but associated with a high incidence of cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction and death.   While improvements in procedural tech- nique and equipment have reduced the incidence in routine cases, many complex cases with a higher risk of complications are now being treated percutaneously. Percutaneous management strategies for coronary perfo- ration include prolonged balloon inﬂation, deployment of covered stents and arterial embolisation.   We report a case of perforation managed successfully with tris-acryl gelatin microspheres embolisation.  

# Case Presentation  

A 76-year-old man presented with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (peak troponin-T   $8.37\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{L}$   [nor- mal   ${<\!0.03]}$  ). He was treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, a beta-blocker, an ACE-inhibitor and a statin. He was enrolled in the EARLY-ACS [Early glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in non-ST-segment elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome] trial,   receiving either intravenous eptiﬁbatide or placebo. Coronary angiography showed a chronic occlusion of the proximal left circumﬂex artery   $(C x)$   with TIMI-I ﬂow, a severe mid-left anterior descending artery

 (LAD) stenosis and mild right coronary artery disease

 (Fig. 1a).  

After administration of 8000 units of heparin, the mid-LAD stenosis was uneventfully treated using a paclitaxel-eluting stent. The  $C x$   lesion was crossed with a High Torgue Intermediate guidewire (Guidant, Santa Clara, CA) that appeared to move freely in the expected course of the distal LCx. After pre-dilatation with a  $1.25\,\mathrm{mm}$   balloon, limited extravasation of contrast from the mid-  $.C x$   into the pericardium (type 2 perforation 2 ) was

detected (Fig. 1b). Percutaneous intervention was aborted but the trial medication (eptiﬁbatide or placebo) was con- tinued. The patient returned to the ward pain-free and ha emo dynamically stable.  

T wo hours later, the patient’s condition deteriorated rapidly with reduced level of consciousness and no recordable blood pressure. His trial medication was discontinued. Transthoracic echo car dio graph y demon- strated a large pericardial effusion with tamponade. Emergency peri car dio cent es is drained  $320\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   of blood, leading to immediate clinical improvement with return of systolic blood pressure to  $130\,\mathrm{mmHg}$  . He did not require intubation.  

Repeat angiography demonstrated continuous ﬂow of contrast into the pericardial cavity (type 3 perforation 2 ) at the level of the mid-  $.C x$   (Fig. 1c). A  $2.0\,\mathrm{mm}$   over-the- wire balloon was positioned in the proximal  $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}$   and was inﬂated to 8 atmospheres, occluding the vessel. Because balloon occlusion alone did not seal the perforation,  $3\,\mathrm{{ml}}$   of EmboGold  $300{-}500\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$   microspheres (Biosphere Medical, Roissy, Paris), suspended 1:1 in diluted contrast solution, were slowly injected distally through the central balloon lumen. Balloon inﬂation was maintained for  $8\,\mathrm{{min}}$   to pre- vent reﬂux of microspheres into the LAD and aorta. As the artery was occluded distal to the perforation, there was no risk of microspheres entering distal collaterals. Repeat angiography revealed complete occlusion of the  $C x$   at the embolisation site with no further leakage of contrast into the pericardial space (Fig. 1d).  

Post-embolisation, a further  $270\,\mathrm{ml}$   of blood was drained over  $24\,\mathrm{h}$  . Subsequent echo car dio graph y showed a small circumferential rim of ﬂuid, with no sign of tamponade.  

# Discussion  

Management of coronary artery perforation includes reversal of anticoagulation, peri car dio cent es is for car- diac tamponade and, when necessary, deﬁnitive treatment of the perforation. While emergency surgery may be required, percutaneous techniques are often successful. Poly tetra u oro ethylene (PTFE)-covered stents 6   and autol- ogous vein grafts covered stents 7   are useful in larger vessels in which the delivery system can be tracked to the perforation site. For distal vessel guidewire perfora- tions and perforations of occluded or small calibre vessels, embolisation with microcoils,   gelfoam,   polyvinyl alco- hol (PVA) particles 10   have been reported to be effective. The published literature comprises case reports, with no method clearly demonstrated to be superior. In this case, it was felt that the vessel was too small for coil embolisation or covered-stent placement. Our previous experience with gelfoam was that injection through the central lumen of a standard angioplasty balloon catheter could sometimes be difﬁcult. Bench testing with microspheres, however, had shown that that they were easily injected down the  $0.014^{\prime\prime}$    catheter and appeared suitable for sealing this perforation.  

Coronary perforation in our patient was related to the attempted crossing of a chronically occluded ves- sel in the setting of intense anti-platelet therapy. In retrospect, attempted percutaneous intervention to a non- infarct related chronic occlusion might better have been undertaken as a second-stage procedure. Percutaneous intervention was promptly aborted upon the detection of contrast extravasation outside the vessel. Continuation of the trial medication (eptiﬁbatide or placebo) may have contributed to continued bleeding into the pericardium. Microspheres, a novel embolisation agent, were chosen because of potential limitations of other techniques in treating this particular perforation.  

Microspheres, containing an acrylic co-polymer (tris- acryl) cross-linked with gelatin, were developed as an alternative to PVA particles in interventional radiol- ogy. They are designed to be hydrophilic, deformable, uniformly spherical particles with a narrow range of par- ticle diameters, contrasting with PVA particles which are irregularly shaped with sharp and jagged edges. A  $300{-}500\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$   suspension contains approximately 10,000 microspheres per millilitre. Problems with PVA parti- cles, such as particle aggregation, hub accumulation and catheter occlusion, are not observed with microspheres. Particulate penetration into a vascular lesion is improved because of avoidance of aggregate formation.   Histo- logical studies have demonstrated a mild-to-moderate inﬂammatory reaction around the microspheres with no evidence of degradation observed in specimens more than 6 months after embolisation.   Previous studies have demonstrated a tight correlation between the diam- eter of the microspheres injected and the size of the occluded vessel.   Therefore, it is likely that vessels of  $300\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$   or larger were occluded by the microspheres, with thrombus formation also contributing to the total occlusion of the LCx.  $300{-}500{-}\upmu\mathrm{m}$   microspheres were chosen in our case, based upon the diameter of the per- forated artery and the minimum inner diameter of the  $0.014^{\prime\prime}$    catheter. The elastic properties of the microspheres allow for temporary compression of up to  $33\%,$  , facil- itating the passage of microspheres through injection catheters.  

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst case report of coronary artery perforation treated successfully by transcatheter injection of tris-acryl gelatin microspheres. While there is a range of options for managing coronary artery per- foration, the use of microsphere embolisation appeared effective in this case and should be considered part of the armoury for managing this serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention.

Late stent thrombosis   $^{(>1}$   year after implantation) is a recognised complication involving drug-eluting stents. Stent fracture is increasingly being reported as a complication of drug-eluting stent, and in particular sirolimus-eluting stent use. We report the case of very late sirolimus-eluting stent fracture resulting in an acute coronary syndrome. This case report highlights the need for greater awareness and post-marketing surveillance to detect a potential mechanism for late stent thrombosis in the drug-eluting stent era.

# Introduction  

T he use of drug-eluting stents has been demonstrated to lower in-stent restenosis (ISR) rates, however the incidence of late complications such as stent thrombosis has raised concern over their use. In addition, there has been increasing awareness of stent fracture as a potential complication following drug-eluting stent implantation. We report a case of sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) fracture precipitating acute coronary syndrome more than 3 years after stent deployment.  

# Case History  

A 65-year-old man underwent coronary angiography for investigation of exertional angina. This conﬁrmed crit- ical lesions in the ﬁrst obtuse marginal branch of the circumﬂex artery (Fig. 1) with minor disease elsewhere and normal left vent ric u lo graph y. Percutaneous coronary intervention to the culprit lesion was undertaken. The lesion was pre-dilated  $2.0\,\mathrm{mm}\times10\,\mathrm{mm}$   conventional angioplasty balloon to 12 atm., followed by deployment of a  $2.75\,\mathrm{mm}\times30\,\mathrm{mm}\;S$  ES to  $12\,\mathrm{atm}$  ., with an excellent ﬁnal result (Fig. 2).  

The patient had an uneventful recovery and remained symptom free for almost 3.5 years, before re-presenting with a troponin positive acute coronary syndrome and electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischaemia in the lateral leads. Coronary angiography was repeated, revealing complete fracture of the previous SES near the midpoint. There was clear displacement of the stent segments from each other, resulting in a kink within the exposed artery (Fig. 3). The other coronary arteries remained unchanged. The stent fracture was treated direct deployment of a   $3.0\,\mathrm{mm}\times13\,\mathrm{mm}$  12 atm., followed by post-dilatation with a 3.5 mm  $3.5\,\mathrm{mm}\times8\,\mathrm{mm}$   × Powersail balloon to  $12\,\mathrm{atm}.$  ., with an excellent ﬁnal result (Fig. 4). The patient remained well at 12-month follow-up, with a negative exercise treadmill test featuring normal exercise capacity.  

# Discussion  

Despite substantial clinical experience with drug-eluting stents in randomised trials and post-marketing reg- istry surveillance, coronary stent fracture has not been highlighted as a signiﬁcant clinical issue in the pub- lished literature. Nonetheless, awareness of this possible complication has recently begun to emerge with the publication of isolated case reports and small series. One such series suggested the prevalence of stent frac- ture may be as high as   $1.9\%,$    with stent fracture occurring in 10 of 530 patients undergoing clini- cally indicated repeat coronary angiography. All of these cases of stent fracture involved sirolimus-eluting
