Abstract —Data are presented on the coloring conditions, colored layer parameters, and color characteristics of stainless steel 304 samples treated in an electrolytic cell (  ${60}\,\mathrm{Hz}$  ,   $\mathrm{100\;\mathrm{mV}}$  ) using a mixture of   $5\;\mathbf{M}$   sulfuric acid and  $2.5\,\mathbf{M}$   chromic acid. Reﬂectance spectra indicate that the samples have high-purity color mainly in the yellow region and that the color is due to interference oscillations in the visible range. In addition, reﬂectance data in conjunction with composition–depth proﬁles obtained using glow discharge spectrometry indicate that the coloration of the samples is due not only to reﬂectance oscillations but also to the subtraction effect. The reduced Fe content and signiﬁcant oxygen content in the near-surface region attest to the formation of a mixed oxide layer. Atomic-force microscopy examination indicates that the sample surface has an island structure.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The coloring of metals is used in architectural and industrial applications for both functional and decora- tive purposes (e.g., the INCO process developed for stainless steel by Evans  et al.  [1]). There are several methods of coloring stainless steel, including heat treat- ment and/or thermal oxidation [2, 3], electrolytic oxi- dation [4], and chemical oxidation [5, 6]. On the other hand, sol–gel-derived coatings produced with metal alkoxides and HCl or   ${\mathrm{HNO}}_{3}$   as catalysts are used to protect stainless steel from oxidizing atmospheres at high temperatures [7].  

The mechanism by which a colored ﬁlm grows on stainless steel immersed in a hot solution of chromic and sulfuric acids is well understood [8–14]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) results [10, 12, 13] demonstrate that, both in the current pulse method with the use of a hot  $2.5\,\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{CrO}_{3}+5\,\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}$   solution and in immersion treatment, the coloring process involves anodic and cathodic reactions in the microcell on a stainless-steel substrate. The former reaction is responsible for anodic dissolution of the three major metallic components Fe, Ni, and   $\mathrm{Cr}.$  , as represented by the general scheme   $\mathbf{M}=$   $\mathbf{M}^{n+}+n\mathbf{e}$  e. The cathodic reaction is responsible for oxide ﬁlm growth owing to the hydrolysis of metal ions, lead- ing to the formation of simple metal oxides and/or mixed metal oxides. The reactants are believed to come from the solution. Using AES, Lin and Duh [12] assessed the elemental concentration proﬁles in colored ﬁlms produced by the current pulse method on SUS304 stainless steel. According to their results, the oxygen content increases from the stainless steel substrate toward the ﬁlm surface, while the Fe content decreases.  

Stoychev  et al.  [14] used XPS to determine the chemical composition of colored ﬁlms produced by immersion (chemical) treatment. They assumed based on their results that the color was associated with the variations in the thickness of the oxide layer formed and in the concentration of Fe and Cr oxides. Other groups focused on the corrosion characteristics of col- ored ﬁlms produced by chemical INCO [15], the mechanical characteristics of colored ﬁlms grown on stainless steel by the current pulse method [16], and the thermal performance of austenitic stainless steel solar absorber plates colored by chemical and thermal oxida- tion techniques [17].  

In this paper, we report an attempt to separately assess the contributions to coloring from interference and color subtraction using chemical analysis by glow discharge spectrometry (GDS), in conjunction with reﬂectance and interference studies.  

# EXPERIMENTAL  

AISI 304 stainless steel plates   $2.5~\mathrm{mm}$   in thickness were cut into square samples  $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   in area, which were then polished to mirror ﬁnish (mean surface roughness of  $0.3\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$  m). Next, the samples were degreased in a hot alka- line solution and cleaned in acetone under sonication. Col- oring was carried out in an electrolytic cell with a plati- num electrode (  $100\;\mathrm{\mV},$     $60\,\mathrm{Hz}$  ). The steel sample served as the working electrode.

The solution, a mixture of   $5\textbf{M}$   sulfuric acid and  $2.5\,\mathbf{M}$   chromic acid, was kept at a constant temperature of  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C with slow stirring to ensure laminar ﬂow at the electrode surface. The samples were immersed in the solution, and a voltage of   $1\mathrm{\bar{0}0\;m V}$   was applied for 10, 15, 20, 25 or   $30\;\mathrm{{min}}$  . In the case of shorter times (less than   $10\ \mathrm{min})$  ), the surface was not colored. At longer times (over  $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$  .), severe corrosion took place, erod- ing the steel. The coloration, green with violet spots throughout, was typically not very vivid. The surface morphology of the ﬁlms was examined by atomic-force microscopy (AFM).  

Reﬂectance spectra were measured on a spectrome- ter with coupled deuterium and tungsten–halogen lamps, spanning the range 190 to   $1600\,\bar{\mathrm{nm}}$   (IR through UV). Illumination and detection were done with the same optical ﬁber at near normal incidence of the light beam owing to the smooth surface.  

Quantitative depth proﬁles (QDPs) of most of the elements in the ﬁlms were obtained with a LECO glow discharge–optical emission spectrometer. The opera- tion conditions were  $700\,\mathrm{V};$   $20\,\mathrm{mA}$  , and an argon pres- sure of  $7\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Pa}$   Pa. The pressure in the spectrometer was  $10^{-3}$   Pa (turbo molecular pump, rotation speed of 9   $9\times$   $10^{4}\,\mathrm{rpm})$   rpm), and that in the glow discharge lamp was  $3\,\mathrm{Pa}$  . Sputtering with argon ions causes sample erosion with an average rate of   $\bar{1}.84\,\upmu\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{min}$  m/min in a spot  $4\,\mathrm{mm}$   in diam- eter. Deexcitation of the removed atoms gives rise to emission at characteristic wavelengths, which is detected by photomultiplier s, one for each element (for some elements, e.g., iron and nickel, two detectors are used). In this way, all the elements are probed simulta- neously.

with slight deviations which had no effect on the gen- eral behavior—only the data for   $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$   are presented.  

Table 1 also gives the chemical composition (wt  $\%$  ) of the layer determined by GDS at 15-, 50-, and  $_{200-\mathrm{nm}}$  depths. The data illustrate the variation in the concen- trations of the major constituents of the alloy and impu- rities originating from the solution.  

The proﬁles in Fig. 1 show that the oxygen and chro- mium contents decrease from the ﬁlm surface toward the stainless steel substrate, while the iron and nickel contents increase, indicating that the ﬁlm surface and stainless steel substrate differ markedly in composition. Therefore, to estimate the thickness of the layer, we assume that the interface corresponds to the steepest slope of the Fe proﬁle   $({\sim}75~\mathrm{nm})$  

As expected, the chromium and sulfur contents increase toward the ﬁlm surface since they come from the chromic and sulfuric acids (in agreement with pre- vious observations [12]); the oxygen concentration also increases. In light of this, we expect the formation of some oxides and/or mixed metal oxides, depending on the oxygen concentration and the distance from the substrate. It also seems likely that, as a result of the anodic dissolution, a large amount of iron removed from the substrate remains suspended or precipitated in the acid solution, which, unfortunately, reduces the efﬁ- ciency of the coloring process.  

The high oxygen content near the ﬁlm surface and the absence of oxygen in the substrate attest to the for- mation of oxides and other oxygen-containing species in the ﬁlm. The nickel and manganese concentrations decrease slightly from the substrate toward the ﬁlm surface.  

Figure 1b shows the depth proﬁle in terms of the number of atoms per gram of the sample. In contrast to

the data in Fig. 1a, low-  $\cdot Z$   atoms (carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) have signiﬁcant intensities, comparable to those of heavier atoms (chromium, iron, and nickel). From such plots, one can gain valuable information about the nominal concentrations of impurities, analyz- ing the shape of the spectra or comparing the oxygen required for the formation of particular compounds with the total oxygen content. For example, in a porous pure silica ﬁlm on a metallic substrate, the number den- sity of oxygen atoms is twice that of silicon atoms. In this work, the ﬁlm   $({\sim}75~\mathrm{nm})$   nm) contained a high concen- tration of oxygen, presumably in the form of metal oxides.  

Interference colors on stainless steel.  The samples obtained through the described treatment showed a uni- form coloration, attributable to interference phenom- ena, which depended on the treatment time and the thickness of the ﬁlm.  

The reﬂectance spectra of the samples are shown in Fig 2a. In analyzing the spectra, we take that an inter- ference maximum is observed when [19]  

$$
d=(2m+1)\lambda/4n,
$$  

where   $d$   is the optical thickness,   $\uplambda$   is the wavelength,   $n$  is the refractive index of the ﬁlm, and   $m$   is an integer (order of interference). In the case of minima,  

$$
d=m\widehat{\lambda}/2n.
$$  

The optical thickness   $d$   does not always coincide with the ﬁlm thickness and depends on the angle of inci- dence, characteristic of interference coloring.  

Table 2 shows the experimental wavelengths obtained for the maxima and minima in the reﬂectance of the samples analyzed, the ﬁlm thickness   $d$   estimated from the Fe depth proﬁle, thickness   $d_{\mathrm{calc}}$   that gives the best ﬁt to the number of maxima and minima, the order of interference   $m$  , and the refractive index   $n$   needed to adjust the wavelength to the experimental value. Lower values of  m  correspond to longer wavelengths.  

As seen in Fig. 2a, the maxima and minima become weaker and narrower as the wavelength decreases. Given that   $m$   is the number of attempts for the light beam to leave the layer, one must take into account that the optical path increases with m , reducing the signal through absorption. On the other hand, the frequency of interference oscillations increases toward the UV, where the absorption is rather high. Our calculations included the UV region.  

Figure 2b shows the calculated refractive indices that adjust the wavelength to the experimental value according to Eqs. (1) and (2). In the range   $300{-}800\;\mathrm{nm}$  , the data correspond to a mixture of  $\mathrm{Cr}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   and Fe  $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   [20].

At longer wavelengths,   $n_{\mathrm{calc}}$   drops sharply, which may be related to the characteristics of the layer, experimen- tal uncertainty, or misinterpretation of the data.  

Table 3 lists the tristimulus values   $(X,Y,Z)$  , chroma- ticity coordinates   $(x,y)$  , corresponding dominant wave- length, percent purity, and CIE 1976   $(L^{*}a^{*}b^{*})$   color parameters [21, 22] for ﬁve samples. In addition, Fig. 3 shows the chromaticity diagram indicating the corre- sponding points for ﬁve samples. The values for our samples fall within the area bounded by the solid curve, which is the locus for the colors in the visible region. Thus, the samples have a real color composed of its spectral components. Furthermore, since the data points lie above the dashed lines, the colors of the sam- ples can be considered a mixture of white light

 (point  $C$  ) and monochromatic light with the wavelength

  $\bar{\lambda}$   indicated in Table 3. Color purity is the ratio of the distance between point   $C$   and the point representing the color of the sample to the distance between point   $\bar{C}$   and the point representing the dominant wavelength   $\uplambda$  (Fig. 3). Our samples had high purity values in the yel- low   $\bar{(560{-}590~\mathrm{nm})}$  ) and orange   $\bar{590{-}630~\mathrm{nm})}$  ) spectral regions. Nevertheless, the spectra of all the samples, except for the one treated for   $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$  , show two maxima in the visible range, which are responsible for the color of the samples.  

Although the color of the stainless steel samples is obviously dominated by the interference phenomena governed by the thickness of the layer, the contribution of color subtraction cannot be ruled out. It is well known that some of the absorption bands of the ions and metals used here [22, 23] coincide with the minima in reﬂectance. Given that Fe and  $\mathrm{Cr}$   are widely used in pigments and dyes, where typical concentrations of these elements are close to those in our samples, we believe that these species also contribute to the color of the samples through the subtraction effect.  

Surface morphology of colored layers.  The AFM images in Fig. 4 illustrate the surface morphology of the samples treated for 10 and  $20\,\mathrm{{min}}$  . The former sam- ple differs very little in roughness from the untreated substrate. By contrast, treatment for 20 min produces drastic changes in surface microstructure, there are well-deﬁned steel grain boundaries, and the austenite grains are seen to have an island structure, in accor- dance with earlier reports [14]. The likely explanation for these changes is that the grain boundaries undergo anodic dissolution and that the austenite grains act as active centers where cathodic reaction takes place, resulting in ﬁlm growth.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

Stainless steel was colored by an electrolytic method  ${}^{(60\,\mathrm{Hz}}$  ,   $100\,\mathrm{mV}$  ) with ﬁve different treatment times.  

Quantitative depth proﬁles obtained with GDS show reduced Fe content and high oxygen content in the near-surface region, attesting to the formation of an oxide layer. In addition, the surface layer contains increased concentrations of chromium and sulfur, which originate from the chromic and sulfuric acids used in our preparations. The concentrations of the other elements present in stainless steel 304 are lower in the surface layer compared to the ﬁlm bulk.  

The origin of the color was inferred from reﬂectance spectra. The observed reﬂectance oscillations were attributed to interference phenomena. The tristimulus values, CIE 1976   $(\mathrm{L}^{*}\mathrm{a}^{*}\mathsf{b}^{*})$   color parameters, chroma- ticity coordinates, corresponding dominant wavelength and percent purity were evaluated for ﬁve samples pro- cessed under different conditions.  

The positions of the samples in the chromaticity dia- gram suggest that their color is a mixture of white light and monochromatic light with the dominant wave- length. The high purity color values, mainly in the yel- low region, are due to two maxima in the visible. More- over, Fe and  $\mathrm{Cr}$   also contribute to the color of the sam- ples through the subtraction effect.  

AFM images showed an island structure which is likely to result from anodic dissolution at grain bound- aries and cathodic reaction on austenite grains.
