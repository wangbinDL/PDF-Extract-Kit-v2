Abstract —Single-crystal ingots of Cd  $\mathrm{Cl}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$  Te solid solutions are grown by the sublimation method. Samples with  = 0.95, 0.90, and 0.85 taken from the end portions of the ingots are chemically homogeneous and have  $p$  -type conductivity with a 300-K hole concentration below 10  $10^{12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$  . Temperature-dependent electrical con- ductivity measurements are used to evaluate the ionization energies of electrically active centers.  

# INTRODUCTION  

$\mathrm{Gd}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$  Te solid solutions are well-known promis- ing semiconducting materials, which have been the subject of extensive studies over the past decade. Most of the research effort has been concentrated on the growth of high-resistivity, defect-rich   $\mathrm{{Cd}}_{x}\mathrm{{Zn}}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{{Te}}$  crystals, primarily by the Bridgman method.  

It is, however, well known that, because of the com- plex phase relations in the CdTe–ZnTe system, chemi- cally homogeneous  $\mathrm{Gd_{\itx}Z n_{1\it-x}T e}$  Te crystals are extremely difﬁcult to grow from the melt: solid solutions enriched in ZnTe, the higher melting point end-member, are always the ﬁrst to crystallize.  

In view of this, we used sublimation of presynthe- sized solid solutions to grow   $\mathrm{Gd}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$  Te crystals.  

In this paper, we report the growth and electrical properties of   $\mathrm{{\bf\hat{C}d}}_{x}\mathrm{{Zn}}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{{\bf\hat{e}}}$  Te crystals.  

# EXPERIMENTAL  

A major problem in sublimation growth is to obtain single-crystal ingots having the same composition as the growth charge. To this end, a certain vapor compo- sition and a slight vapor supersaturation at the growth interface must be maintained, and the latent heat of crystallization must be removed rapidly, which implies that quasi-isothermal conditions are needed. For exam- ple, Szczerbacow  et al.  [1] reported that, in the growth of  $\mathrm{Gd}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$  Te crystals by this method, the evaporation and condensation temperatures differed by   $_{1-2^{\circ}\mathbf{C}}$  Under such conditions, however, we failed to grow sin- gle-crystal ingots. In view of this, we used a three-zone growth geometry (Fig. 1) to prepare   $\mathrm{Gd_{\itx}Z n_{1\it-x}T e}$  Te crys- tals. The evaporation and growth conditions were deter- mined by temperatures   $t_{2}$   and   $t_{3}$  , which differed by  $_{4-5^{\circ}\mathbf{C}}$  C. Varying the temperature of the third zone,   $t_{1}$  , we tuned the vapor supersaturation at the growth interface;  

$t_{1}$   exceeded   $t_{2}$   by 3–4  $_{3-4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}$  C. A key role in determining the thermal conditions of crystal growth was played by temperature  $t_{2}$  : the choice of   $t_{1}$   and   $t_{3}$   depended on   $t_{2}$  . In our experiments,  $t_{2}$   was 100  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C below the solidus tem- perature of the solid solution. The growth ampule

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Chemical analysis of sublimation-grown crystals showed that the ingot composition was the same as the charge composition only in the case of quasi-isothermal conditions, that is, at low temperature gradients at the growth interface and slow ampule pulling.  

At large differences between   $t_{2}$   and   $t_{3}$     $(>\!10^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  selective etching of the (111) face revealed prismatic inclusions surrounded by mosaic blocks. At such tem- perature gradients, the ingot (especially its upper por- tion) and growth charge differed somewhat in composi- tion. Moreover, under such growth conditions the con- centration of electrically active centers determining the electrical conductivity of the material varied along the ingot, which was probably due to the high vapor super- saturation at the growth interface and compositional ﬂuctuations in the vapor phase.  

From the spectral dependences of the photocurrent through samples taken from different parts of the ingots and the absorption coefﬁcients of the samples at 300 and   $80~\mathrm{K}$  , we determined the band gap of   $\bar{\mathrm{C}}\mathrm{d}_{x}\mathrm{Z}\mathsf{n}_{1-x}\mathrm{T}\mathrm{e}$  as a function of composition. We obtained  $E_{\mathrm{g}}=1.60\pm$   $0.05\ \mathrm{eV}$   at  = 0.95 and 1.67   $1.67\pm0.05\mathrm{\eV}$   = 0.90, in reasonable agreement with the linear dependence of   $E_{\mathrm{g}}$  on composition. These data were then used to determine sample composition (the uncertainty was within   $5\%$  ).  

All of the ingots were  $p$  -type, with a hole concentra- tion below   $10^{12}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$   and 300-K hole mobility from 40 to   $80\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\;\mathrm{s})$  /(V s), depending on the sample.  

Figures 2 and 3 show the Arrhenius plots of dark conductivity for samples taken from different parts of the   $\mathrm{Cd}_{0.9}\mathrm{Zn}_{0.1}\mathrm{Te}$  Te ingot. As seen, the samples differ in both electrical conductivity and the slope of the plots in the impurity region. In the temperature range studied, the slope of the plots (ionization energy of electrically active centers) for the samples cut from the upper end of the ingot is 0.55, 0.44, 0.36, and   $0.33~\mathrm{eV}.$   The sam- ples taken from the back end of the ingot contained acceptor centers with ionization energies  $\dot{E}_{\mathrm{v}}+(0.012-$  0.22) and  + (0.28–0.35) eV (Fig. 3).  

Near liquid-nitrogen temperature, some of the sam- ples contained shallow electrically active centers with ionization energies of 0.56 and   $0.{\dot{7}}6~\mathrm{eV},$   as determined from the spectral dependences of the photocurrent.  

Most of the centers in   $\mathrm{Gd}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$  Te have the same ionization energies as in CdTe. Kosyachenko  et al.  [2] proposed a classiﬁcation of electrically active centers according to their energy. In that classiﬁcation, centers with ionization energies in the range  $E_{\mathrm{v}}+(0.12{-}0.20)\,\mathrm{eV}$  are assumed to be acceptor complexes each composed of a doubly charged cadmium vacancy and a donor impurity:   $(V_{\mathrm{Cd}}^{2-}D^{+})^{-}$  . Note, however, that levels with

energies of 0.12 and, e.g.,   $0.17\,\mathrm{eV}$   may be encountered in the same sample.  

The level with an ionization energy of   $0.28~\mathrm{eV}$   is worthy of special mention. According to Mayer and Stadler [3], this level is due to   $\mathrm{Cu}$   impurity. In this work, however, it appears systematically in samples that have been in contact with the silica ampule and may, therefore, be contaminated with both silicon and oxygen [4].

The second group is constituted by electrically active centers with energies   $E_{\mathrm{v}}~+~(0.\dot{3}3{-0.44~\mathrm{~eV}})$  . According to Hage-Ali and Siffert [5], these are native defects, in particular singly charged cadmium vacan- cies, which no doubt play an important part in out sam- ples. Such ionization energies are, however, also char- acteristic of C  $\mathrm{u}{:E_{\mathrm{v}}+(0.28\mathrm{-}0.35\;\mathrm{eV})}$   [3].  

Figure 4 shows the Arrhenius plots of dark conduc- tivity for a sample with  $x=0.9$   which was exposed to an oxygen atmosphere at   $300~\mathrm{K}$   for ten days and then stored in air for eight months. After the oxygen expo- sure, the slope of the plot is   $0.36~\mathrm{eV}.$   Subsequent air storage has no effect on the slope.  

Note that crystals grown in a hydrogen atmosphere typically have a level with an ionization energy of  $\dot{0.33}\;\mathrm{eV};$   while levels at   $0.36\,\mathrm{eV}$   are very uncommon in such crystals.  

Thus, the conductivity of   $\mathrm{Gd}_{x}\mathrm{Zn}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{Te}$   crystals is determined by a rather broad spectrum of electrically active centers. The spread in ionization energies obtained in electrical measurements is attributable pri- marily to the changes produced in the energy of accep- tors by the Coulombic interaction between ionized donors and also to relaxation processes, which take place in all of the crystals under consideration. Relax- ation processes are more pronounced in high-resistivity crystals with deep levels. The relaxation time in such crystals depends on temperature and may attain several hours. For this reason, equilibrium is essentially never reached in temperature-dependent resistivity measure- ments, especially at low temperatures, and the activa- tion energy evaluated from temperature-dependent resistivity data is always overestimated.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The present results demonstrate that sublimation growth can be used to prepare   $\mathrm{{Cd}}_{x}\mathrm{{Zn}}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{{Te}}$   crystals close in structural perfection to Bridgman-grown crystals.
