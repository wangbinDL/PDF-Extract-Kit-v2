Abstract —Based on the principle of maximum bond energy, a structural model is proposed for Si  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}\ +\$  60 wt   $\%$   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}+5$   + 5 wt  $\%\,\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}+1.5\,\mathrm{wt}\,\%\,\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   ceramics. In this model, Si  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   clusters form a star-like struc- ture with columnar pores 0.45 and  $1.5\;\mathrm{nm}$   in size. The smaller pores are ﬁlled with  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   molecules, and the larger pores are ﬁlled with   $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   and Al  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$   clusters. The solubility of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   molecules in silicon nitride is  $70\;\mathrm{wt}\;\%$  , and those of  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   and Al  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$   are 5.45 wt  $\%$  . The energies of intercluster interaction in two mutually perpendicular directions are 3.2 and  $5.5\;\mathrm{eV},$   which is comparable to bond energies in structural metallic mate- rials. The lattice parameters of molybdenum disilicide are determined by   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray diffraction. The formation of  $\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$   and   $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   molecules during thermal cycling has an insigniﬁcant effect on the structure of the material.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Structural ceramic materials possess high mechani- cal strength and fracture toughness in combination with enhanced thermal stability, hardness, wear resistance, oxidation stability, and corrosion resistance and low density [1]. The use of such ceramics is, however, lim- ited by their inherent brittleness and insufﬁcient ther- mal-shock resistance, difﬁculties in mechanical and thermal treatment, and the lack of simple, reproducible fabrication processes [1].  

The ability to improve the physicochemical proper- ties of nanoceramic materials depends crucially on pre- cise knowledge of the underlying interactions at the atomic, molecular, and cluster levels and the optimiza- tion of the fabrication process.  

# ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL APPROACHES  

The intraatomic, intramolecular, and intercluster interactions in ceramic materials can be understood in terms of a two-particle quantum-mechanical model, which allows one not only to clarify the adhesion mech- anism but also to optimize the technology of high- strength coatings [2].  

Pair interaction can be represented by a convergent series of the form  

$$
E_{\mathrm{b}}\;=\;\sum_{n\,=\,1}^{\infty}{\frac{a_{n}}{r^{n}}}.
$$  

The   = 1 term describes interaction between point charges, which is responsible for covalent and ionic bonding. At  $n=2$  = 2, the bonding is due to the interaction between point charges and dipoles. This type of bond- ing occurs if at least one of the interacting particles has an intrinsic electric moment. This is characteristic of atoms in which one valence electron has an elongated orbit and interacts with excited electrons which have spherical orbits or more elongated orbits   $(S-P,P-D$  , and other, analogous conﬁgurations). The   = 3 term (third approximation) represents dipole–dipole interac- tion, which occurs primarily in ionic crystals. Higher order terms were left out of consideration because their contribution to the bond energy is insigniﬁcant.  

The formation of nanoclusters was analyzed theo- retically in [3]. The principle of maximum (in magni- tude) bond energy suggests that the formation of com- plex molecules involves several steps. The ﬁrst to form are radicals—two-component molecules with free chemical bonds. Next, the free chemical bonds become saturated via interaction of the molecules with one another and the attachment of other atoms (molecules) to the resultant multiatomic structure. The process con- tinues until all of the chemical bonds of the original atomic structures are saturated. Based on the proposed mechanism of the formation of complex molecules, consider, as an example, the molecular structures that are used in producing nitride ceramics with tailored electrical properties:  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$  ,  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$  ,  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  , and Al  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  .  

Silicon nitride exists in two polymorphs:   $\upalpha{-}\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$  (low temperatures) and   $\upbeta{-}\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   (high temperatures). The two modiﬁcations have hexagonal structures. The lattice parameters of   $\mathrm{ox-Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   are   = 0.7818 nm and    $c=$   $0.5591\,\mathrm{nm}$  , and those of   $\upbeta{-}\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   are   = 0.7595 nm and = 0.29023 nm [1]. The   ${\upalpha}\longrightarrow{\upbeta}$   transition is irrevers- ible [4].  

The main structural component of silicon nitride is an   $\mathrm{SiN_{4}}$   tetrahedron. The structure of Si  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   is made up of groups of three tetrahedra which share a nitrogen atom and are   $120^{\circ}$   apart. The structures of   $\upalpha\cdot$  -  and  $\upbeta{-}\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   differ in the stacking of the tetrahedra along the c  axis.  

The best sintering aid for silicon nitride is a mixture of  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   and Al  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  , which ensures the formation of a Si–Al–O–N liquid phase and, accordingly, efﬁcient densiﬁcation of silicon nitride [4]. A  $\mathbf{t}\simeq\!1\bar{40}\bar{0}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  ,  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$  and Al  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$   react with the   $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   layer on the surface of

  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   particles to form a eutectic melt, in line with the

  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\mathrm{-Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\mathrm{-Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   phase diagram. This process ensures densiﬁcation of the material. At the same temperature, the  ${\upalpha}\longrightarrow{\upbeta}$   transformation of Si  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   begins [5, 6].  

Silicon nitride is a dielectric material. Conducting additives, such as TiN,   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$  , TaC, and La  $\mathrm{La}_{2}\mathrm{CrO}_{3}$  impart metallic properties to Si  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   ceramics, which extends their application ﬁeld.  

Figure 1 schematically illustrates the formation of  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   molecules. In the   $\upalpha$   form, the three silicon atoms and two nitrogen atoms form a symmetrical structure. In the  $\upbeta$  -form, the symmetry is distorted, and the struc- ture is not tetragonal (Fig. 1c).  

The structure of silicon nitride in the basal plane is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The main clusters are sep- arated by columnar pores, which form a pore structure. The minimum pore size is close to the diameter of the  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   molecule   $(0.67\,\mathrm{nm})$  . The bond energy is determined by the dipole–dipole interaction. In the basal plane, the bond energy for the main clusters is  $1.4\:\mathrm{eV}.$   The resultant bond energy is   $3.2\,\mathrm{eV}.$   In the vertical direction, the poten- tial energy of the electric dipoles is   $0.461\ \mathrm{eV},$   and the resultant bond energy is   $5.532~\mathrm{eV}.$   Therefore,   $\upbeta{-}\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   is comparable in bond energy to metals.  

$\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$  ,   ${\mathrm{A}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  , and Y  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   have simple cubic struc- tures, characteristic of ionic crystals. With allowance made for the repulsion from the second neighbors, the bond energy in the cluster structure of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   is  $1.136\,\mathrm{eV}.$   Those in the molecular structures of   ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  and   $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   are 1.344 and   $0.611\ \mathrm{eV},$   respectively. The cluster structures of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$  ,  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  , and  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   molecules must break up at 1923, 2325, and   $908^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  , respectively. The simple cubic structures characteristic of ionic crys- tals are rather loose. Each cluster is surrounded by four columnar pores of diameter   $(\sqrt{2}\,-\,1)d_{\mathrm{cl}}$  , where   $d_{\mathrm{cl}}$   is the diameter of the main cluster.  

Silicon nitride has a rather loose, cluster structure (Fig. 3) and, accordingly, low mechanical strength. An applied mechanical load gives rise to screw shear strain, which may eventually cause alignment of electric moments and an explosive structure breakdown. One way of preventing this is by ﬁlling the intercluster pores. The ﬁller must have a large electric moment, and the size of its main cluster must slightly exceed the pore diameter. The former condition ensures strong dipole– dipole coupling in a certain position in the pore, and the latter leads to lattice distortions, which markedly reduce the screw shear strain under an applied load.  

Cluster structures may contain pores of various sizes. Small pores may be ﬁlled with individual mole- cules, and large pores, with clusters. The main clusters

The main clusters of  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   are also large enough to ﬁll the pores in   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$

almost entirely. Since the cluster structure of   ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  breaks up at relatively high temperatures, large alumina particles may ﬁll only those pores associated with structural defects in silicon nitride. Accordingly, the starting mixture for the preparation of   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   ceramics typically contains only 1.5 wt   $\%$     ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$  . The cluster structure of   ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$   degrades notably at relatively high temperatures, and its main clusters may ﬁll large columnar pores in silicon nitride. This conclusion is supported by the results reported by Rigel  et al.  [5]: the  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$   solubility in   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   is   $67\ \mathrm{mol}\ \%$   at   $1750^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and 78 mol   $\%$   at   $1850^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . These data ﬁt well with the decomposition temperature of the cluster structure of  ${\mathrm{Al}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$     $^{2325^{\circ}\mathbf{C})}$  .  

To ﬁll all of the large columnar pores in  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$  , the amount of   $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   in the starting mixture must be

 5.45 wt   $\%$  . According to experimental data, the optimal

  $\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$   content of   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   ceramics is about 5 wt   $\%$   [4], which is 0.45 wt   $\%$   lower than the theoretically pre- dicted value.

It follows from the structure of the main cluster in  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   that   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   will ﬁll small columnar pores and that the electric moments of its molecules will be arranged in series. As a result of shear strain, molecules with antiparallel electric moments will have a new arrangement of their electric moments and will ﬁll small columnar pores. Thus, for each columnar struc- ture ﬁlled with   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   with a certain direction of its electric moment there are two columnar pores with an opposite direction of electric dipoles.  

The interaction between the electric moments of  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   in the small columnar pores enhances the strength of the cluster structure of silicon nitride. The additional cohesion energy in the cluster structure of silicon nitride is   ${\simeq}0.08\bar{8}~\mathrm{eV}$   per main cluster. The resultant bond energy of the molecules in the main clus- ter of silicon nitride is  ${\simeq}2.86\;\mathrm{eV}.$  

Each main cluster in the structure of   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   is sur- rounded by three small columnar pores. Given the dif- ference in size between the  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   and  $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   molecules, the necessary amount of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   is  ${\simeq}70$   wt   $\%$  .

no need for high temperatures: all of the small colum- nar pores can be ﬁlled with  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   molecules under the action of relatively weak consecutive thermal shocks.  

Heating to relatively high temperatures leads to cat- alytic decomposition of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   into MoSi and Si. The interaction between an Si atom and   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$   molecule leads to decomposition of the latter. As a result, four SiN dipole molecules and one MoSi dipole molecule are formed. Thus, the resulting material has ionic bond- ing and, hence, is a typical dielectric.  

# EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS  

Based on the above observations, we developed a process for the fabrication of ceramics, which were then characterized by   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray diffraction (XRD) and microstructural analysis. As the starting materials, we used UBE-SN-E-10   $\mathrm{{\bf\dot{S}i_{3}N_{4}}}$   powder (KOKUSHI, Japan); yttrium acetate  $\mathrm{Y}(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\mathrm{COOH})_{3}\cdot\simeq\!4\:\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$   (Johnson Mat- tey, Germany); aluminum isopropoxide   $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OC}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{7})_{3}$  ,  $98\%$   (Johnson Mattey); and   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   (Starck, Germany).

Molybdenum disilicide was ground to a particle size of   $0.8–1.4\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$  . After addition of the   $\mathrm{Si}_{3}\mathrm{N}_{4}$  -based mix- ture   $(\mathrm{MoSi}_{2}$   : mixture  $=1:3$   to  $1:10_{c}$  ), the powder was thoroughly mixed by grinding. The compaction and sintering procedures were similar to those described in [7]. The sintered bodies were subjected to multiple thermal cycles in the range   $500–1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in a PL 10/12.5 bench-top resistance furnace, followed by holding in the furnace for   $5~\mathrm{min}$   and cooling to room temperature in air. The structure and phase composition of the resultant ceramics were examined by XRD.  

XRD patterns were collected on a Siemens D-500 and DRON-3 diffractometers (  $\mathrm{Cu}K_{\upalpha}$   radiation, graphite monochromator, continuous scan rate of   $2^{\circ}(2\uptheta)/\mathrm{min})$  ). The phases present were identiﬁed using an application program.  

Figures 5–7 illustrate the phase composition of the 40 wt  $\%$   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}+\mathrm{Si_{3}N_{4}}+5$   wt  $\mathrm{\small{\%}\,Y_{2}O_{3}+\hat{1}.5\,w t\,\%\,A l_{2}O_{3}}$

sample after sintering and thermal cycling to different temperatures.  

The XRD pattern of the as-sintered sample shows reﬂections from molybdenum disilicide and silicon nitride (Fig. 5). The strongest peak from  $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$  , 110, has a very low intensity. In a certain temperature range,  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   may chemisorb oxygen to form a molybdenum oxide. At   $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the peaks from   $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   grow consider- ably, and peaks from  $\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$   emerge, attesting to oxida- tion of molybdenum disilicide [8]:  

$$
2\mathrm{MoSi}_{2}+7\mathrm{O}_{2}\longrightarrow2\mathrm{MoO}_{3}+4\mathrm{SiO}_{2}.
$$  

Figures 8–10 display the microstructure of the sample before and after heat treatment. The loose layer on the sample surface consists of  $\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$  .  

According to Kurokawa  et al.  [8], above   $750^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$   $\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$   is not the main product of  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   oxidation in air. The process is dominated by reaction  

$$
5\mathrm{MoSi}_{2}+7\mathrm{O}_{2}\longrightarrow\mathrm{Mo}_{5}\mathrm{Si}_{3}+7\mathrm{SiO}_{2}
$$  

instead of reaction (2). The same is evidenced by XRD data after thermal cycling to   $1200^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  : the XRD pattern shows peaks from  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   and  $\mathrm{Mo}_{5}\mathrm{Si}_{3}$  . The microstruc- ture of the sample after thermal cycling to   $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   is shown in Fig. 10.  

The lattice parameters of  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   were determined by the formulas  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle a\,=\,\frac{\lambda}{2}\sqrt{\frac{l_{1}^{2}(h_{2}^{2}+k_{2}^{2})-l_{2}^{2}(h_{1}^{2}+k_{1}^{2})}{l_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\Theta_{2}-l_{2}^{2}\sin^{2}\Theta_{1}}},}\\ {\displaystyle c\,=\,\frac{\lambda a l_{2}}{\sqrt{4a^{2}\sin^{2}\Theta_{2}-\lambda^{2}(h_{2}^{2}+k_{2}^{2})}},}\end{array}
$$  

where   $\uplambda$   is the   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray wavelength,   $h_{1}k_{1}l_{1}$   and   $h_{2}k_{2}l_{2}$   are the Miller indices of two diffraction peaks from the phase of interest, and  $\theta_{1}$   and  $\uptheta_{2}$   are the respective Bragg angles. We used the 213   $(\theta_{1}=75.68^{\circ})$   and 116   $(\uptheta_{2}=$   $85.70^{\circ})$   reactions from  $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$  .  

The data in the table demonstrate that thermal cycling has an insigniﬁcant effect on the lattice param- eters of   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   (experimental uncertainty of 1 and  ${<}1\%$  for the samples with initial particle sizes of 0.483 and  $0.583\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  , respectively). The obvious reason is that the atomic radius of oxygen   $(0.0665\ \mathrm{nm})$   is substantially smaller than those of silicon   $(0.133\;\mathrm{nm})$   and molybde- num   $(0.079\ \mathrm{nm})$   [9]; accordingly, the forming   $\mathrm{MoO}_{3}$  and   $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$   molecules produce insigniﬁcant lattice distor- tions in molybdenum disilicide.  

The lattice strain arising in molybdenum disilicide owing to the formation of  $\mathrm{\dot{Mo}}_{3}$   was assessed from the width  $B$   of the 116 peak, which was determined with an accuracy of   ${\simeq}2.5\%$   and   ${<}5\%$   for the samples with an average particle size of 0.483 and   $0.851~\mathrm{\textbar{\upmu\mathrm{m}}}$  , respec- tively. Independent of the   $\mathrm{MoSi_{2}}$   content, raising the temperature from 500 to   $1200^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   slightly increased the lattice strain on account of the thermal expansion mis- match between the constituents of the material. This effect was more pronounced at   $60\;\mathrm{wt}\;\%\;\mathrm{MoSi}_{2}$  .
