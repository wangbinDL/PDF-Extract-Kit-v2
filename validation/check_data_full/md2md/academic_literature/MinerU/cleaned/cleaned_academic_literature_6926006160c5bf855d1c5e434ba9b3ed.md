It was named as International Conference on Experimen- tal Ulcer (ICER) (from 1970 to 1991) and International Con- ference on Ulcer Research (ICUR) (from 1994 up to now).  

The First International Conference was organized at  Copenhagen, Denmark in 1970, in conjugation with Fourth  World Congress of G astro enter ology. The other Conferences  were organized at Cologne, Germany (1972), at Parádfürdö,  Hungary (1976), at Tokyo, Japan (1980), at Boston, USA. 

 (1985), at Jerusalem, Israel (1988), at Berlin, Germany 

 (1991), at Kyoto, Japan (1994), at Hong Kong (1997), at Bu- dapest-Pécs, Hungary (2000), at Dubrovnik, Croatia (2003)  and now at Osaka, Japan (2006).
