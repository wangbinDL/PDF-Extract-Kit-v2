Abstract —CdTe/CdS he t ero structures are analyzed in terms of a   $p{-}i{-}n$   model in which the  i  layer consists of a   $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{S}_{x}$   solid solution resulting from Te and S diffusion into CdS and CdTe, respectively. The lattice parameters of the solid solution are determined. The   $i$   layer is shown to be too thick for tunneling.  

# INTRODUCTION  

In the fabrication of he t ero structures, high-resistiv- ity layers often appear at heterojunctions [1]. The study of the formation and properties of such layers is of sci- entiﬁc and technological interest because they may offer an effective means of controlling the physical properties and enhancing the performance of semicon- ductor heterostructures.  

In this paper, we present evidence for the formation of a high-resistivity   $i$    layer at CdTe/CdS heterojunc- tions and analyze the effect of this layer on the photo- electric properties of the heterostructure.  

# EXPERIMENTAL  

CdTe/CdS he t ero structures   $1~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$   in area (Fig. 1) were fabricated as described elsewhere [2]. The front contact in the form of a comb was made by thermal evaporation  $(\sim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Pa})$   Pa) of indium. The width of the con- tact strips was   $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}$  , and the contact separation was  ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{mm}$   mm. The back contact was made of molybdenum.  

The elemental composition of the CdTe/CdS inter- face was determined using an electron probe   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray microanalyzer (Cameca). The samples were taper-pol- ished at a tilt angle of 1.5° . Analyses were performed at  $25{\mathrm{-}}{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$  m intervals, corresponding to depth proﬁling with a step of  $0.65\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  

The phase composition of the interfacial layer was determined by   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray diffraction on a DRON-1UM dif- fractometer   $(30\ \mathrm{kV},\ 20\ \mathrm{mA},$  ,   $\mathrm{Cu}K_{\upalpha}$   radiation,   $\lambda_{\upalpha_{1}}\;=\;$  1.5405 Å,   $\lambda_{\upalpha_{2}}\;=\;1.5443\,\mathrm{~\AA~})$  . In determining lattice parameters, measurements were made in the step-scan mode with a step size  $\Delta(2\Theta)\!=\!0.01^{\circ}$   and a counting time of  $20\:\mathrm{s}$   per data point. The lattice parameter was deter- mined as  

$$
a\,=\,d_{h k l}\sqrt{h^{^2}+k^{^2}+l^{^2}}\,.
$$  

For   $2\Theta=56.9^{\circ}$  , we obtained    = 5.8935 Å, which is intermediate between the lattice parameters of CdS  = 5.832 Å) and CdTe (  = 6.423 Å). This attests to the formation of an interfacial layer which differs in properties from CdTe and CdS. Therefore, the hetero- structure consisted of  $p$  -CdTe, CdTe  $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{x}$  , and   $n$  -CdS layers.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Figure 2 shows the composition–depth proﬁle of a CdTe/CdS heterostructure. The interface is seen to be rather sharp. Note that the CdTe and CdS layers are enriched in Te and Cd, respectively, and are, accord- ingly,    $p$  - and   $n$  - type. In addition, S atoms diffuse into CdTe, similar to what was reported in [3–5], and Te atoms diffuse into CdS to a depth of   ${\sim}1~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$  m. These results point to the formation of an interfacial layer con-

sisting of a CdTe  $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}S_{x}$   solid solution. A similar layer was found in [3–5] by near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscopy.  

Given that CdTe is polycrystalline, we infer from the data in Fig. 2 that the interfacial layer is nonuniform in thickness. Therefore, its conductivity type and elec- trical parameters are difﬁcult to determine.  

To assess the spectral distribution of photosensitiv- ity, we measured the short-circuit photocurrent through  $\mathrm{ddot}_{1\,-\,x}\mathbf{S}_{x}/\mathrm{ddot}_{\mathrm{T}}\mathbf{e}$  /CdTe and CdS/CdTe  $\mathrm{CdS/CdTe}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{S}_{x}/\mathrm{CdTe}$  /CdTe hetero- structures (Fig. 3) at photon energies from   $E_{\mathrm{g}1}$   (band gap of CdTe) to  E  $E_{\mathrm{g}2}$   (band gap of CdS).  $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{S}_{x}/\mathrm{Cl}\mathrm{Te}$  /CdTe he t ero structures were produced by dissolving away CdS in HCl, followed by applying indium contacts to the surface of the solid solution. As seen in Fig. 3, the two types of he t ero structures have identical long-wavelength limits of photo sensitivity, whereas the short-wavelength limit in  $\mathrm{\dot{C}d T e}_{1\,-\,x}S_{x}/\mathrm{C}\mathrm{d}\dot{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{e}$  lies  at  lower  energies  in  comparison  with  $\mathrm{CdS/CdTe}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{S}_{x}/\mathrm{CdTe}$  

Note that the photo sensitivity of CdTe  $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}S_{x}/\mathrm{ClTe}$  he t ero structures is substantially lower than that of  $\mathrm{CdS/CdTe}_{1\,-\,x}\mathrm{S}_{x}/\mathrm{CdTe}$  /CdTe. This seems to be due to the absence of any barrier between CdS and the solid solu- tion, the formation of surface states after CdS removal, the low potential barrier between the   $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{x}$   and CdTe layers, and the signiﬁcant thickness of the inter- facial layer.  

The spectral dependence of the photocurrent through   $\hat{\mathrm{CdS/CdTe}}_{1\,-\,x}\hat{\mathrm{S}}_{x}/\mathrm{CdTe}$  /CdTe he t ero structures was studied in the photodiode mode at room temperature and different reverse biases   $V_{\mathrm{r}}$  . We found two peaks in

photocurrent, at   $\lambda_{1}\,{\simeq}\,600\,\mathrm{nm}$   nm and   $\lambda_{2}\simeq800\,\mathrm{nm}$   nm. In addi- tion, the photocurrent was shown to increase steadily with increasing   $V_{\mathrm{r}}$  . At   = –2 V, the photo sensitivity at  $\uplambda_{2}\simeq800\;\mathrm{nm}$   $\mathord{\sim}0.9$   A/W, which exceeds the zero-bias photo sensitivity by about a factor of 3. Note also that, with increasing reverse bias, the peaks in the photocur- rent become sharper. Moreover, the spectral position of the shorter wavelength peak depends on the hetero- structure fabrication procedure. These results suggest that the interfacial layer (responsible for the increased short-circuit photocurrent) consists of a high-resistivity solid solution [6] and that its composition depends on the fabrication procedure.  

Also important is the question of the interfacial layer thickness. The slope of the current–voltage char- acteristic of the structures under consideration depends on temperature (between 300 and  $450\:\mathrm{K}$  ). According to theoretical studies [1, 7, 8], this is possible if the thick- ness of the base in a   $p{-}i{-}n$   structure exceeds the level required for tunneling. Therefore, it seems likely that the electrical transport is not due to the tunneling [1] or excess tunneling [7] mechanism. In analyzing the elec- trical properties of the he t ero structures, the solid solu- tion must then be taken into account as a high-resistiv- ity i  layer.  

The experimentally determined collection coefﬁ- cient of the structures studied is   ${\sim}1$  . This implies that the  $i$    layer may serve as a base in solar cells. The pho- tocarriers in this layer may easily diffuse to the barrier and be separated there. The short-circuit current den- sity, open-circuit voltage, and quantum efﬁciency of the structures under illumination of   $100\;\mathrm{\mW/cm}^{2}$   are  ${\sim}12\;\mathrm{mA}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  ,  ${\sim}0.6\,\mathrm{V},$   and   ${\sim}8.0\%$  , respectively. The rel- atively low values of these parameters (e.g., compared to the   ${\sim}16.5\%$   efﬁciency reported in [9]) demonstrate that the structure requires much optimization work.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The present results indicate that, during the fabrica- tion of CdTe/CdS heterostructures, a high-resistivity   $i$  layer consisting of a  $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}S_{x}$   solid solution is formed at the interface. This layer is too thick to assume that the charge transport across   $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{x}$   is due to tunneling but, at the same time, too thin to serve as a base in solar cells. The lattice parameter of   $\mathrm{CdTe}_{1-x}\mathrm{S}_{x}$   is intermedi- ate between those of CdTe and CdTe.
