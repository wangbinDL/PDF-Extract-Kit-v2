In the period during and immediately following the WorldWar, great interest was manifested in the teaching of current events in the schools.Manyjunior and senior high schools experimented with methods andmaterialsin current events and adopted a permanent program, either providing special classes in the subject or providing specific correlation with history, civics, or oral English. Since that time suggestions for the adoption of a similar program in the ele- mentary schools have occasionally been put forward,but as a rule these suggestions have not been given serious consideration.The generalfeeling seems to have been that children in the middle grades are too immature, their background of information too re- stricted,andtheir reading ability too limited to warrant any ex- pectation that they might be able to understand present-day prob- lems.  

Here and there a few teachers and principals have undertaken to carry on the study of current events in the middle grades, but after several semesters many of them gave up the attempt,declaringthe availablematerialstobeunsuitedfortheuseofyoungchildren. Others have continued the study during one reading period a week even though theydid not feel fully satisfied with theresults.None of them,however, so far as the writers are aware, has consistently measured results or presented evidence as tothe children's under- standing or interest.  

Meanwhile, significant changes have been taking place in educa- tion. The results of the great improvement in silent reading are be- ginning to make themselves felt throughout the entire elementary- school system,especially in the later middle grades. Children in the fifth and sixth grades are now reading as well as children formerly read some grades in advance. Consequently, the need of new mate- rials is being keenly felt.At the same time there is being at- tempted in the social sciences a very genuine and widespread re- organization of materials, with the objective of choosing problems and activities inline with social values andlife-situations.Educators everywhere are emphasizing the desirability of awakening interests and developing attitudes as early in the child's experience aspossible in order that the cumulative force of many years of practice may carry over those interests and attitudes into life after the child leaves the schoolroom.Valuable allies for such an attempt are now fur- ni shed by the newsreels in themotion-picturehouses andbythe rotogravure sections of the metropolitan newspapers,both ofwhich are usually available to elementary-schoolchildren throughout the country.  

Like all other students of the social sciences,the writers have been much concerned with these changes and have been eager to investi- gatetheireffectsontheabilityofmiddle-gradechildrentoreadcur- rentevents.Mostopportunely,an invitation came to them to under- take for a period of two years, ending in June, 1931, the editorship of the only news periodical for middle-grade children then existing, namely, the News-Outline, published by the American Education Press. They accepted the invitation as a challenge to experiment in this untried field, to measure results, and to discover whether those results would warrant any conclusions.  

Thefirstproblemwasthesetting-upofaneducationalprogram Itwas obvious that materials chosen for young children shouldbe subjected toa doubletest:(1)accuracy and(2)suitability to chil- dren's interests and capacities. The experimenters therefore drew up for their own guidance a set of principles and policies, which (with the changes and adaptations suggested by two years of experience) follows.  

# GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES  

1.[Adopted at the end of the first year as a result of following the fourth- gradework.]Mostfourth-grade children do not have sufficient command of the reading process nor sufficient background in knowledge of the world to enable them to read a current-events paper with profit.  

2.A completerésuméof the newsof the world isunsuited totheinterests and capacities of children in the fifth and sixth grades.Topics should be care- fully selected,and only a few should be presented at one time.  

3.A variety of interests should be built up—political,geographical,eco- nomic,mechanical, artistic, scientific,etc.Foreign news should be included as wellasdomesticnews.  

4. In each issue the leading article should dwell at some length on an im- portant phase of world-news.It should carry with it the necessary explanation for building up a rich background of understanding.A few other short articles (perhaps two to four)may deal with other selected topics.  

5.Whenfeasible,theleading articles maywell alternate foreign and domestic news.They should also attempt to present successively news of a predominantly political, historical, geographic, economic, and social nature.  

6.In order that continuity of treatment may be secured, the shorter articles should usually include a follow-up treatment of a topic which has formerly con- st it u ted a leading article.  

7. Material which is merely interesting reading does not justify its appear- ance in a current-events paper.The items included should serve materially to introduce children to important problems of present-day institutions.  

8.Inasmuch as most schools will devote only one reading period a week to currentevents,the amount of material in one issue should probably be measured by the possibilities of this half-hour aweek.  

9.Since middle-grade children are not careful readers of the newspapers pro- duced for adults,the factor of importance of a news item should outweigh the factor of exact timeliness.  

Io.Children's information can be tested.Their interest in the materials however,can best be judged by their classroom teachers.  

# THECONDUCTINGOFTHEEXPERIMENT  

From the outset the experimentfaced a serious disadvantage in thephysical makeup ofthepaper.Thefact that the sheetwas only  $\mathsf{5_{2}^{1}}$  by  $8_{2}^{\mathbf{1}}$  inches in size necessitated the use of very small type and seriously impaired the value of the few pictures that could be in- cluded.The results secured were attained in spite of the u natt rac- ti ve appearance of the paper.Teachers were helped to make the reading more interesting, however, by a sheet on “Teaching Current Events,' which was sent out at the beginning of the first year.  

Each weekly issue contained a leading article,fromtwotofour shorterarticles,and an entire page devoted to tests and activities in variousforms.The tests were informal objective tests based on the leading article. The “activities' suggested things to do to awaken interest and to develop understanding  

All the first year was devoted by the experimenters to practice in choosing and adapting materials for fifth- and sixth-grade children.1 They also followed the reactions ofseveralgroups ofchildrentothe differing types of materials that were presented week by week. At the beginning of the second year the writers felt that the testing pro- gram might be inaugurated. Through the co-operation of the pub- lishers the names of 35 teachers teaching 992 children in 17 states were secured. These teachers expressed their willingness to ad- minister the weekly tests,record their results on a tabulation sheet furnished them, and send in a report at nine-week intervals. Other teachers reported for one,two,or three terms but did not serve dur- ing the entire year. These schools represented large cities, villages, and rural areas, and both public and parochial organizations. The publishers also generously co-operated in printing andmailing the recordsheets.  

In addition to a tabulation of the test results,theteacherswere asked to furnish the following information.  

I. To the Teacher: Ask the children to write the answers to the following questions and,in the blanks below,fillinthenames of the stories receiving the highest votes with the reason most generally given.  

A.Which of thefront-page stories that you have read in theNews-Outline, Numbers 1 to 9, inclusive, do you like best? (Look back in your note- book if you do not remember the names of the front-page stories.) Name ofstory. Why did you like it best? B.Which second best? Name of story Why did you like it? C. Which third best? Nameofstory Why did you like it?  

II. Ask the children to write“yes"or“no"in answer to the following question Names need not be signed. Does your family take a daily newspaper? A weekly newspaper?  

1 It was soon evident that classes in current events were unsuitable for most fourth grades.  

Number of families taking a daily newspaper A weekly newspaper Number of children in the class Inwhotoradearethev?  

III. Will the teachers please answer these questions. 1. How many pupils in your room give evidence of reading newspapers?  

Check the things they dowhich makeyou think they read newspapers: a)Bring pictures to school. b)Tell the class additional material.  

2.In the time you have for reading the News-Outline does it seem to you that the quantity of material in the paper is sufficient,orshouldthe quantity be doubled?(check)Present quantity sufficient Quantity should be doubled  

3.Inyour judgment is the language used suitable for fifth-grade children? Ifnot,which topics presented the greatest reading difficulties?(Tobe answered only by fifth-gradeteachers)  

4.Check the right statement below:  

I find the page of tests and teachers'helps in the News-Outline a)Veryhelpful b）Helpful c)Notofmuchhelp  

5.If you feel that this page is not of much help, will you please tell what changeswould make it morevaluable toyou?  

# THE FINDINGS  

In order that the reader may understand the type of current- events material used in the study,the titles of the front-pagestories are given in Table I. The classifications into political, historical, geographical, economic, and social have been made according to the particular interpretation of the news given in the story.  

A summary of the pupils' first, second, and third choices of stories in each of the four nine-week periods appears in Table II. Nine stories of domestic news ranked first,second,or third in the choices of these pupils, while six stories of foreign news received such rankings. Seven of the favorite stories are classified as political andhistorical, five are classifed as geographical, and three as economic and social. Thechoices of these children seem toindicate thatfifth-grade and sixth-grade pupils are interested in both foreign and domestic news  

  

and that they have greater interest in the important phases of world news than has been commonly believed by teachers and school ad ministrators.

TableIII shows the types of illustrations used with the stories which the pupils liked best. Thirty-five stories were voted on. Eight of the thirty-five had no front-page illustrations.Some significance maybe attached to the fact that fourteen of the fifteen stories voted as first, second, or third choices had front-page illustrations.  

Whilethisstudysecurednodataastotheattractivenessofthe paper from the point of view of size of the page and the size of type, the experimenters feel that the need for a larger and more attractive paper is imperative. A larger paper with larger type would, of course, cost much more than the middle-grade current-events paper now available, and no commercial firm can be expected to put such a paper on the market unless the schools can support the enterprise. The publication of such apaper would appear tobe aprojectworth subsidizing by a foundation interested in education.  

An attempt was made to measure the difficulty of each selection through objective tests-—-true-false, multiple-choice, completion, and completion of outlines.A comparison of the ranks of stories accord- ingtotheease ofreading as shown by these tests andtheranks ac-

cording to choices shows little or no relationbetween choices and easeof reading.However,thescores of thepupils on all the objective tests were sufficiently high to indicate that the storieshad been com- prehended by a majority of the pupils. Since the highest scores were consistently made on thetrue-false and the multiple-choice types oftests,the conclusion seems warranted that the scores were deter- mined by the form of the test and not by the ease of reading the stories.TableIV shows the comparative ease of reading the stories as revealed by the comprehension tests.  

The replies to the question asking whether the pupils' families take daily or weekly newspapers show that approximately 85 per cent of the families represented in the study take dailypapers and that be- tween 6o per cent and 7o per cent take weekly papers. Teachers re- portedthat about 5 o percent of the pupils gave evidence of reading newspapers by bringing pictures to school and by reporting addi- tionalinformationtotheclass.  

Thirty teachers reported on the suitability of the material as to language difficulties. Of these thirty, twenty-seven had found the language suitable, and three reported the language of a few stories to be too difficult.  

Fifty-one votes out of fifty-four indicated that the quantity of materialintheNewsOutlinewassufficienttoservetheneedsof teachers of fifth and sixth grades.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The data seem to justify the following conclusions.(1)An interest in important world-news of a variety of types, including political, historical, geographical, economic, and social, can be aroused in fifth- and sixth-grade pupils. (2) Fifth- and sixth-grade pupils can readworld-news intelligently if it is presented to them with the proper explanations and in language suitable for young readers.(3) It seems probable that classroom use of a current-events paper which introduces pupils to important phases of world-news encourages read- ing of newspapers outside of class and serves as a guide to newspaper- reading. (4)Attractive illustrations infuence pupils’ choices of stories. (5) A weekly current-events paper including enough material forathirty-minute class period is sufficient to meet the needs of teachers of fifth and sixth grades.
