Abstract —Polycrystalline PbGa  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   was synthesized from commercially available and additionally puriﬁed Pb, Ga, and Se. As shown by chemical analysis, the material prepared from as-purchased reagents exhibited signiﬁcant deviations from stoichiometry. According to microstructural analysis, this material contained a sec- ond phase.  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   synthesized from additionally puriﬁed   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se was uniform in composition. The highest degree of puriﬁcation was ensured by the Bridgman–Stockbarger method, which enabled growth of sto- ichiometric single crystals. Attempts to purify  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   by directional solidiﬁcation, zone melting, and thermal evaporation led to decomposition of the material. According to mass spectrometry results, the major products of  $\bar{\mathrm{PbGa}}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   decomposition are  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}$  ,  $\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , and   $\mathrm{Re}_{2}$  .  

# INTRODUCTION  

$\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$  , a   $\mathrm{IV-III}_{2}\mathrm{-VI}_{4}$   compound existing in the  $\mathrm{PbSe{-}G a}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$   join of the ternary system Pb–Ga–Se, is commonly prepared as described by Eholie  et al.  [1], who melted stoichiometric mixtures of   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se in silica tubes sealed off under vacuum. They obtained dense black ingots of composition   $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   as deter- mined by chemical analysis.   $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   crystallizes in orthorhombic symmetry with lattice parameters    $a=$   $10.64\,\mathring\mathrm{A}$  , = 10.77 Å, and   $c=6.539\textup{\AA}$  

The purpose of this work is to study the behavior of Pb, Ga, Se, and impurities during the synthesis and puriﬁcation of polycrystalline   $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}S e_{4}}^{-}$   and crystal growth. Data are also presented on the dissolution kinetics  and  temperature-dependent  vaporization behavior of  $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{{Se}_{4}}}$   crystals.  

# EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS  

Polycrystalline PbGa  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   was synthesized by a two- zone process: Se was maintained at  $700–750^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C, and  $\mathrm{Pb}$  and   $\bar{\mathrm{Ga}}$  , at   $750–800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C. The synthesis duration was   $48-$   $60\,\mathrm{h}$   for a sample weight of  $0.3\,\mathrm{kg}$  . The highest temper- ature was  $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C. The synthesized material was homog- enized at   $750\,\pm\,1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C for   $^{24-30\mathrm{~h~}}$   and then furnace- cooled. The temperature of the furnaces was stabilized to within   $\pm0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   using VRT-2 precision temperature controllers.  

The material was characterized by   $\mathbf{X}$  -ray diffraction (XRD), microstructural analysis, and differential ther- mal analysis (DTA), and its composition was deter- mined by chemical analysis.  

The XRD pattern of PbGa  $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}S e_{4}}$   could be indexed in an orthorhombic cell with   $a=\mathbf{\check{1}}0.638\mathrm{~\AA~}$   $b=10.766\textup{\AA}$  and   = 6.357 Å, in agreement with earlier results [1].  

Etching with a   $1:3$   mixture of   ${\mathrm{HNO}}_{3}$   and H  $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  revealed a second phase, which was identiﬁed as car- bon by careful microstructural examination. The sources of carbon were bituminous impurities in sele- nium. The polycrystalline material was analyzed for Pb, Ga, and Se.  

Pb was determined by titration with Trilon B in an acetate buffer solution at  $\mathsf{p H\,5}$   in the presence of Xyle- nol Orange as the indicator (relative error of determina- tion,   $0.2\Bar{-}0.7\%)$  ) [2].  

Ga was determined by chelatometric titration, with PAN as the indicator (relative error of determination,  $0.7{-}0.9\%)$   [3].  

Se was determined spec tro photometric ally in the form of a complex with 3,3-di amino benz i dine (relative error of determination,   $0.6{-}1.2\%)$  ) [4].  

Polycrystalline PbGa  $\mathrm{PbGa_{2}S e_{4}}$   was Se-deﬁcient, as deter- mined by chemical analysis: the Se content was found to be 43.35 wt   $\%$  , against the nominal value of 47.68 wt  $\%$  . Se losses were also observed earlier in the synthesis of  $\mathrm{{C}d G a_{2}S e_{4}}$   and  $\mathrm{{CuAsle}}_{2}$   [5, 6]. In all cases, deviations from stoichiometry were associated with the use of as-purchased selenium. The  $\mathrm{Pb}$   and Ga contents of   $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}\hat{S}e_{4}}$   also differed from the stoichiometric val- ues (Table 1).  

These results suggest that, to obtain high-purity  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   crystals, commercially available Pb, Ga, and Se must be puriﬁed further.

Pb (V000 grade) was puriﬁed by acid etching, high- temperature heat treatment, and zone melting, which reduced the total impurity content to   $10^{-5}–10^{-7}$   wt   $\%$  .  

Ga (OSCh V000) was puriﬁed by acid etching and high-temperature vacuum heat treatment. The total impurity content after puriﬁcation was at a level of  $10^{-5}$   wt  $\%$  . The Cd and  $\mathrm{Hg}$   contents were below the cor- responding detection limits.  

Se (OSCh 17-4) was puriﬁed by acid etching, vac- uum distillation, directional solidiﬁcation, and zone melting, which reduced the concentrations of major impurities by two to three orders of magnitude and the carbon concentration to below the detection limit.  

The polycrystalline growth charge synthesized from the additionally puriﬁed Pb, Ga, and Se was phase-pure by XRD. Microstructural examination revealed no car- bon. It was more uniform in composition compared to the charge prepared from as-purchased   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se (Table 1).  

Attempts were made to further purify this material by directional solidiﬁcation, zone melting, and the Bridgman–Stockbarger method. In the ﬁrst two puriﬁ- cation processes,   $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}S e_{4}}$   decomposed according to the scheme  

$$
\mathrm{PbGa_{2}S e_{4}}\longrightarrow\mathrm{Pb S e}+\mathrm{Ga_{2}S e_{3}}.
$$  

The products, both PbSe and Ga  $\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$  , had nonsto- ichiometric compositions.  

$\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}S e_{4}}$   crystals were grown by the Bridgman– Stockbarger method in silica ampules pumped down to 0.1–0.01 Pa. The solidiﬁcation rate was  $0.{\hat{1}}{-}0.5\;\mathrm{mm/h}$  , and the temperature gradient was   $5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{mm}$  

Preliminary results on the puriﬁcation of the  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   charge by crystallization indicated that increasing the free space in the ampule led to partial

  $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{{Se}_{4}^{-}}}$   decomposition. In view of this, in growing

  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   crystals by the Bridgman–Stockbarger method, the free space in the ampules was minimized  $(10{-}20\%)$  .  

In this way, we obtained black ingots similar in shape to the ampules, with a convex upper part. This shape was favorable for driving impurities from the central part of the ingot to its periphery. Indeed, the sur- face layer that was in contact with silica was found to contain gas inclusions 2 to  $3\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  m in size and 4   $4\times10^{-2}$   to  $7\times10^{-3}$   wt   $\%$   Si. As shown by XRD, microstructural examination, and chemical analysis, the ingots were single-crystalline.  

The crystals prepared using as-purchased   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se had non stoic hio metric compositions. The devi- ation from stoichiometry was smaller in the neck (Table 1).  

Those crystals exhibited cleavage in the basal plane, breaking into several parts, which indicated that impu- rities resided predominantly in the gaps between the layers and that the crystals were structurally imperfect (Table 2). The highest purity was achieved in the mid- dle portion of the ingots, which contained Fe, Si, As, Ti, and other impurities.  

The   $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   crystals prepared using puriﬁed   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se had nearly stoichiometric compositions (Table 1) and displayed good cleavage properties paral- lel to the basal plane. The middle (highest purity) por- tion of the crystals contained evenly distributed Tl and In impurities. In the upper part of the ingots, the major impurities were Cu, Fe, Al, Cd, As, Mg, Zn, and Mn (Table 2).  

According to DTA results, the melting points of the polycrystalline   $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   growth charges prepared from as-purchased and additionally puriﬁed   $\mathrm{Pb}$  , Ga, and Se were   $778\pm5$   5 and 786   $786\pm5^{\circ}\dot{\mathbf{C}}$  C, respectively. The  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   melt solidiﬁed after supercooling, which attained 34 and   $21^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  C for the growth charges prepared from as-purchased and additionally puriﬁed chemicals, respectively.  

The dissolution behavior of single-crystal  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$  was studied in inorganic and organic solvents (Table 3). The highest dissolution rate was observed in concen- trated  $\mathrm{\bar{HNO}}_{3}$  . With decreasing  ${\mathrm{HNO}}_{3}$   concentration, the dissolution rate of   $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   decreases. Increasing the temperature accelerates  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   dissolution in nitric acid. In benzene and concentrated   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}$  , HCl, and KOH,  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   dissolves only partially.  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   sol- ubility in   $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$  , acetic acid, toluene, acetone, ethanol, and Trilon B is insigniﬁcant.  

Vaporization   $\mathrm{{PbGa}_{2}S e_{4}}$   single crystals was studied using an MI-1201 mass spectrometer ﬁtted with a band- shaped ion source for analysis of solids [7]. In the gas source, one of the cathodes was replaced by an effusion cell. The crystals were vaporized from tantalum Knud- sen cells in the range  $60\bar{0\mathrm{-}1}300~\mathrm{K}$  .

Since mass spectra depend on the ionizing-electron energy, we measured the ionization efﬁciency curves of the forming ions in order to identify the ions and major vapor species (Fig. 1). From the initial portion of the curves, we determined the appearance potentials of the ions by linear extrapolation. The major vapor species were identiﬁed by comparing the fusion and ionization potentials. Calibration was performed against the appearance potential of   $\mathrm{Hg}\,(10.4\,\mathrm{eV})$  .  

According to the present experimental results,  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}$   vaporizes quantitatively starting at   $950\,\mathrm{~K~}$  . Below   $1070\,\mathrm{K}$  , the dominant vapor species is  $\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}$  . At higher temperatures, the vapor phase also contains  $\mathrm{G}\bar{\mathrm{a}}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$  ,   $\mathrm{Re}_{2}$  , and   $\mathrm{Pb}$  . In addition, the mass spectrum shows signals from Ga,  $\mathrm{Ga}_{2}$  , Se, and  $\mathrm{GaSe}_{2}$  , due to dis-

$$
3\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{4}\longrightarrow\mathrm{PbGa}_{2}+2\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{Se}+2\mathrm{Pb}+5\mathrm{Se}_{2}.
$$  

From the temperature-dependent ion currents for the major vapor species (Fig. 2), we evaluated their partial heats of vaporization [8, 9].  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The present results demonstrate that, to obtain homogeneous, high-purity   $\mathrm{PbGa_{2}S e_{4}}$   growth charges and crystals, high-purity starting chemicals and opti- mized synthesis and growth procedures are required.
