# Abstract  

Methylation at arginines has recently come to attention as a post translational modification of proteins, which is implicated in processes from signaling, transcriptional activation, to mRNA processing. Here we report that several proteins extracted from HeLa cells were methylated by PRMT1 (protein arginine  $N$  -methyl transfer ease 1) even on a nitrocellulose membrane, while proteins from  Escherichia coli  are not methylated with this protein. Screening PRMT1 substrates from a  E gt11-HeLa cDNA library, we found that more than half of the 48 cDNA clones obtained encode putative RNA-binding proteins that have RGG (arginine–glycine–glycine) motifs, such as hnRNP R (heterogeneous nuclear rib on u cleo protein R) and hnRNP K. We cloned two novel arginine methylation substrates, ZF5 (zinc finger 5) and p137GPI (GPI-anchor protein p137), which do not possess typical RGG motifs. We also cloned a novel protein that has RGG motifs, but does not have any other RNA-binding motifs. We tentatively termed this clone SAMT1 (substrate of arginine methyl transferase 1).  $\mathrm{A}_{63\cdot}\mathrm{VLD}_{-65}$   to AAA mutation of PRMT1 suppressed the methylation of recombinant SAMT1 and other RGG proteins in the HeLa extracts. This systematic screening of substrate proteins with the solid phase methylation reaction will contribute to identify new roles of PRMT

# 1. Introduction  

Methylation of arginine residues by covalent modifica- tions occurs in eukaryotic proteins during or shortly follow- ing mRNA to protein translation. Evidence for posttransla- tional methylation of arginine residues was first provided by the presence of radioactive species chromatograph ing at positions near that of arginine in acid hydrolysates of isolated calf thymus nuclei proteins incubated with [meth-  $\mathrm{{y}^{14}C]}$  - S -adenosyl- L -methionine (SAM)  [1] . The products of  $\mathit{N}^{\mathrm{G}}$  the methylation reaction were determined to be -mono- methylarginine and    $N^{\mathrm{G}},\!N^{\mathrm{G}}$  -dimethyl arg in in e  [2] . Protein  $N$  arginine   -methyl transfer as es (PRMTs) catalyze the sequential transfer of methyl groups from SAM to the guanidino nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins [3,4] . It now appears that there are at least two distinct classes of protein arginine methyl transfer as es according to their substrate specificity and reaction products  [4] . The type I enzymes catalyze the formation of  $\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathrm{G}}$  -monomethy- larginine and asymmetric  $N^{\mathrm{G}},\!N^{\mathrm{G}}$  -dimethyl arg in in e residues, while type II enzymes catalyze the formation of  $N^{\mathrm{G}}$  -mono- methylarginine and symmetric    $N^{\mathrm{G}},\!N^{\prime\mathrm{~G~}}$  -dimethyl arg in in e. The asymmetric dimethyl arg in in e appears to be the more common form while symmetric dimethyl arg in in e has so far been identified only in a few proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP)  [5] , and spliceosomal  $\mathrm{sm}$   proteins D1 and D3 (SmD1 and SmD3)  [6] . Reported type I enzymes are the yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p  [7]  and the mammalian PRMT1  [8] , PRMT3  [9] , and CARM1/PRMT4  [10] . PRMT1 and yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p prefer to methylate arginine residues in glycine rich regions, which are found in several RNPs, fibrillarin, and nucleolin  [11] . However, CARM1/PRMT4 has little or no activity with substrates preferred by these enzymes, and the best substrate reported for CARM1/ PRMT4 is histone H3  [10] . JBP1/PRMT5 can methylate histone H2A and H4 and myelin basic protein (MBP)  [11] . Recently, a potential candidate for a type II enzyme, JBP1/ PRMT5, has been discovered in mammalian cells with an apparent homologue in yeast, Hsl7  [12] . Yet, its sequence is well conserved with other family members, the catalytic activity of PRMT2 has not yet been demonstrated  [13] . The conservation among protein arginine    $N$  -methyl transfer as es  

may underscore the potential biological importance of this post translational modification. In addition to these, the type III enzyme was also recently discovered in yeast, and this catalyzes the monomethylation of the internal  y -guanidino nitrogen atom of arginine residues  [14] .  

PRMT1 knockout mouse has already been established, and the phenotype of the homozygous null mutant is embryonic lethal  [15] , suggesting that PRMT1 is required for very early stages of mouse development. Though recent evidence has implicated arginine-specific protein methyl- transferases in nuclear export of some hnRNP proteins and in several signaling pathways (reviewed in  Ref. [4] ), spe- cific roles of protein methylation and the relevant protein substrates have not been identified. Because each methyl- transferase recognizes a different set of protein substrates, systematic analysis of their substrate specificity is now required for differentiating their function. To this end, we report here a new expression cloning strategy to identify substrate proteins of PRMT1, which is potentially applica- ble to isolate substrates specific for each member of the PRMT family.  

# 2. Materials and methods  

# 2.1. In vitro methylation reaction  

In vitro methylation assay was performed as described by Najbauer et al.  [16]  with a few modifications. One micro- gram each of recombinant proteins was added in a  $20~\upmu\mathrm{l}$  reaction mix containing  $50~\mathrm{mM}$   Na-morpholinepropanesul- fonic acid [MOPS]   $\left(\mathrm{pH}~7.2\right)$  ,  $300~\mathrm{mM}$  , NaCl,  $2~\mathrm{mM}$   ethyl- ene dia mine tetra acetic acid [EDTA],   $1\,\mathrm{\mum}$   phenylmethyl- sulfonyl fluoride [PMSF],  $0.1\;\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   leupeptin and  $0.4\,\upmu\mathrm{M}\,S$  - adenosyl- L -[ methyl -  $\mathrm{.^{3}H]}$   methionine   $\mathrm{[^{3}H-S A M]}$   (specific activity of   $1.3\ \mathrm{Ci/mmol}$  ; Amersham Biosciences, NJ) with  $0.02\!-\!0.04~\upmu\mathrm{g}/\upmu\mathrm{l}$   recombinant PRMT1 or bovine serum albumin [BSA] (as a negative control) and incubated at 30  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $45~\mathrm{min}$  . The methylation reaction was terminated by adding  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Each  $20\,\upmu\mathrm{l}$   reaction solution was then loaded onto a   $15\%$   SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated by electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue R- 250 to visualize protein bands and then fluorographed, dried and exposed to Kodak film at  $-\,80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 days.  

# 2.2. Solid phase methylation assay  

Cell extracts were size-separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis [SDS-PAGE] and transferred to a nitro- cellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated in a reaction mix containing 50 mM Na-MOPS   $\left(\mathrm{pH}\ 7.2\right)$  , 300 mM NaCl,  $2\:\mathrm{mM}$   EDTA, 1 mM PMSF,  $0.1\;\upmu\mathrm{g/ml}$   leupeptin, and  $0.4~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}~^{3}{\mathrm{H-SAM}}$   with  $1~\upmu\mathrm{g}$   of recombinant PRMT1 at  $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $1\mathrm{~h~}$  , washed with PBS [phosphate-buffered saline] and TPBS [Tris–phosphate-buffered saline], fluorographed, dried, and exposed to Kodak film at  $-\,80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 2 days.

The filters were then washed three times for  $20\;\mathrm{min}$   in PBS, incubated for  $30~\mathrm{min}$   at  $4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   in the methylation buffer (50 mM Na-MOPS  $[\mathsf{p H\_7.2}]$  ,  $2\:\mathrm{mM}$   EDTA,  $0.3\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{NaCl}$  ,  $0.1\;\upmu\mathrm{g}/$  ml leupeptin,   $1~\mathrm{mM}$   PMSF,   $0.4~\upmu\mathrm{M}$   $^3\mathrm{H}{\cdot}\mathrm{SAM}$  ; specific activity of   $1.3~\mathrm{Ci/mmol}$  ) with   $0.02\mathrm{-}0.04~\upmu\mathrm{g/\upmul}$   of recombi- nant PRMT1 and further incubated at  $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $^{2-3\mathrm{~h~}}$   for the solid-phase methylation with gentle agitation. The filters were then washed with TPBS three times for  $20\;\mathrm{min}$   and air dried.

(BioMax MR-2, Kodak, NY) at    $-\,80~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for 1 week. At the first screening, 607 positive clones were detected in  $2.0\times10^{5}$    plaques. We picked up 100 of these clones and succeeded to isolate 83 positive clones by the third screen- ing. Positive clones were converted to plasmids with the Exassist/Solr  $E$  . coli  system (Stratagene).  

# 2.4. Northern hybridization analysis  

SAMT full-length cDNA probe or    $\upbeta$  -actin probe was labeled with radioactive   $[\upalpha-^{32}\mathrm{P}]$   dCTP using the multi- prime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech, CA) membranes were used. Hybridization was carried out at  $42\,\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$    ybridi xture   $(6\times\mathrm{~SSC~}$     $[1\times$  SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate], 50% formamide,   $1\%$     $1\times$  Denhardt’s solution,   $10\%$  dextran sulfate, 100  $100~\upmu\mathrm{g}$  g of denatured salmon sperm DNA per ml). The membrane was washed three times at room temperature in washing buffer (  $0.1\times$   SSC,   $0.1\%$   SDS), and the hybridized transcripts were observed with a BAS2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo).  

# 2.5. Cell culture and transfection assays  

HeLa cells were grown on cover slips in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium [DMEM] supplemented with  $10\%$   calf serum,   $100\ \mathrm{\:U/ml}$   penicillin, and   $100\ \mathrm{\OmegaU}/\mathrm{m}1$  streptomycin. Expression vectors of pGFP (Clontech) containing cloned full-length cDNAs were introduced into cells at approximately   $60\%$   confluence with Lipofect- AMINE (Life Technologies, NY) following the trans- fection conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. For immuno flour esc en ce, cells were washed in PBS and fixed for   $15\;\mathrm{\min}$   with   $4\%$   para formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, permeabilized, and blocked in PBS con- taining  $0.4\%$   Triton X-100,  $1.5\%$   BSA, and  $5\%$   normal goat serum.  

# 3. Results  

# 3.1. Detection of methylated proteins by PRMT1 on a nitrocellulose membrane  

First we examined whether proteins in HeLa cell extracts could be methylated by PRMT1 on a nitro- cellulose membrane. HeLa cells were cultivated for 3 days in the presence of the methyl transfer as e inhibitor, 20  $\upmu\mathrm{M}$   adenosine dialdehyde (AdOX), to prevent endoge- nous methylation that would mask our assay. Nuclei and cytosolic fractions were then size-separated on SDS- PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with recombinant human PRMT1 and the methylation substrate  $^3\mathrm{H}{\cdot}\mathrm{SAM}$   $30\ \ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for   $30~\mathrm{\min}$  . Four major bands and seven minor bands in the nuclei fraction appeared after 2 days exposure  (Fig. 1A, lane 3) , whereas four major bands and three minor bands appeared in the cytosolic fraction  (Fig. 1A, lane 4) . All these bands were faint or absent in extracts prepared from HeLa cells cultivated without AdOX  (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2) , suggesting that most arginines in these proteins were already methylated in vivo in HeLa cells. To further examine the validity of the in vitro methylation reaction on the nitrocellulose membrane, we methylated recombi- nant hnRNP A1 under the control of an IPTG promoter in    $E$  . coli.  Proteins were isolated from IPTG-treated or -untreated whole  $E$  . coli  containing recombinant hnRNAP A1, separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitro- cellulose membrane. Methylated proteins were specifically detected in the IPTG-induced    $E$  . coli  containing hnRNP A1  (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) . In    $E$  . coli  not containing human hnRNP A1, no positive band was found in IPTG- treated  $E$  . coli  (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) . These results show in vitro methylation by PRMT1 is specific to the human protein and that    $E$  . coli  does not methylate the human protein, at least at the proprietorial arginine residues. These results prompted us to perform a com- prehensive substrate screening of PRMT1 using a  E gt11- HeLa cDNA expression library in    $E$  . coli  host with IPTG-induced cDNA protein products separated on the nitrocellulose membrane.  

# 3.2. Expression screening of PRMT1 substrates  

Fig. 2  shows the experimental order of the screening (Fig. 2A)  and a representative of the first and third screening  (Fig. 2B) . After the first screening, 607 positive clones were detected in  $2.0\times10^{5}$    plaques. We picked up 100 of these clones and succeeded to isolate 83 positive clones by the third screening. We determined the nucleo- tide sequences of 48 of these clones. A BLAST search [17]  against GeneBank revealed that more than half of the clones encode putative RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNP R, hnRNP K, GRY-RBP (glycine, arginine, and tyrosine-rich RNA binding protein),   ${\mathrm{TAFII}}_{68}$   (TBP asso- ciated factor   $\mathrm{II}_{68}$  ), RBP56 (RNA binding protein 56), and TLS/FUS (translocated in liposarcoma), as summarized in Table 1 . A common feature of these proteins is to contain RGG motifs at their C-terminus (indicated by stripes in the right end column of  Table 1 ). Eight clones encoded the same novel protein, which also has RGG motifs at its C-terminus, but not other RNA-binding motifs. We termed this clone SAMT1 (substrate of arginine methyl- transferase 1). The predicted amino acid sequence of SAMT1 is shown in  Fig. 3A . During preparation of this manuscript, a clone named CG1-55 coding the identical protein to SAMT1 was registered to the database of GeneBank, as one of conserved human genes by com- parative proteomics  [18] . Northern blot analysis of SAMT1 mRNA showed ubiquitous expression in human tissue samples  (Fig. 3B) . We tagged cloned cDNAs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP-tagged SAMT1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm around nucleus, presumably at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while the other RGG-proteins were localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells  (Fig. 4) . Other five clones encode a transcription factor, ZF5 (zinc finger 5) and a GPI (glycosyl ph os phat idyl in osi to l)-anchor protein, p137GPI. Both of these proteins do not have typical RGG motifs.  

# 3.3. Methylation of cloned proteins by PRMT1 in vitro  

To determine whether the cloned proteins are really methylated by PRMT1 in vitro, we prepared recombinant proteins of GST (glutathione sul fa transfer as e)-ZF5, GST- p137GPI, GST-hnRNP R, GST-GRY-RBP,   $\mathrm{GST-SAFII_{68}}$  , GST-TLS, and GST-SAMT1  (Fig. 5A) . These proteins

Fig. 4. Intracellular localization of cloned proteins. HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vectors, fixed, and analyzed by indirect immuno fluorescence staining. PRMT1 was expressed as a fusion protein with the HA epitope and stained with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (a). The cloned RGG proteins, hnRNP R (b), GRY-RBP (c), TLS (d),  ${\mathrm{TAFII}}_{68}$   (e), and SAMT1 (f) were tagged with GFP protein and stained with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse second antibody was used to visualize each protein. Scale bar in (a):  $20~\upmu\mathrm{m}$  .

 $\mathrm{7AFI_{68}}$   (lane 3), GST-TLS (lane 4), GST-SAMT (lane 5), GST-ZF5 (lane 6), and GST-GPI anchor protein (lane 7) were purified from  $E$  . coli  and incubated with [methy  $|^{3}\mathrm{H}]$  -SAM in the presence of recombinant PRMT1. GSTwas used as a negative control (lane 8). Methylation of each protein was detected by autoradiography (upper panels) and protein amount of each methylation reaction was confirmed with Coomassie staining (arrow heads of lower panels). (B) The  $_{63\cdot}\mathrm{VLD}_{-65}$   to AAA mutation of  $\mathrm{7AFI_{68}}$   and GST-SAMT1 were incubated with HeLa cell extract,  $^3\mathrm{H}$  mutant at  $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$  . The amount of the RGG proteins were normalized by Coomassie staining as shown in the lower panels.  

were then incubated at   $37\ \mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for  $30\,\mathrm{\min}$   with recombi- nant PRMT1 and  $^3\mathrm{H}$  -SAM. All of above proteins were highly methylated by PRMT1, while GST alone was not methylated  (Fig. 5A) . These proteins were methylated  $^3\mathrm{H}$  when they were incubated with HeLa cell extracts and   - SAM  (Fig. 5C) . Next, we tested the effect of a dominant- negative PRMT1 on methylation of HeLa cell extracts. We mutated PRMT1 cDNA by substituting alanines for three amino acids, valine 63, leucine 64, and aspartic acid 65, located in the highly conserved region that is proposed to be important for SAM binding and thus for me thy tl ran sf erase activity  [10] (Fig. 5B) . The VLD to AAA mutation of PRMT1 abolished the enzymatic ability to methylate hnRNP A1 in vitro (data not shown). Administration of the mutant PRMT1 suppressed the methylation of GST-hnRNP A1,  $\mathrm{GST-SAFII_{68}}$  , and GST-SAMT1 by the extract  (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that these proteins are methylated mainly by PRMT1 in the HeLa cell extract.  

# 4. Discussion  

Protein function is often modulated by post translational modifications; phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation, and methylation. Though an important role for protein methylation in bacterial chemotaxis has long been appreci- ated (reviewed in  Ref. [19] ), a role of protein methylation in signal transduction has not been explored in mammalian cells with the same breadth and intensity that protein phosphorylation has enjoyed in recent years. Unlike phos- phorylation, protein methylation might be irreversible, because protein demethylases have not been discovered so far  [20] . Yet, this may be a key mechanism of cell function as a growing number of proteins are being found to contain methylated amino acids, mono methyl arg in in e and asymmet- ric dimethyl arg in in e. Many of these proteins are associated with RNA, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo- protein (hnRNP) A1  [21,22] , the U3 small nuclear RNA- binding protein fibrillarin  [23] , the rRNA binding protein nucleolin  [24] , poly(A)-binding protein (PAB) II  [25] , the Src-associated substrate, Sam68  [26] , interleukin enhancer binding factor3  [27] , and the yeast Npl3 protein  [28,29] . As a result, the hnRNPs contain about  $65\%$   of the total  $\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathrm{G}}\!,\!\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathrm{G}}$  - dimethyl arg in in e found in the HeLa cell nucleus  [11] .  

The site of arginine methylation for type I enzymes typically occurs within glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domains from which similar consensus sequences have been derived  [4,7,16,30] . A search of the GenPept database for a consensus FGGRGGF motif revealed 13 substrate candi- dates  [16] . Of these, 10 were known or presumed to interact with RNA  [16] . In our expression screening, we did not isolate any of 13 candidates, and seven of cloned 9 genes encode hnRNP R, hnRNP K, GRY-RBP,  ${\mathrm{TAFII}}_{68}$  , RBP58, TLS/FUS, and SAMT1, respectively, all of which contain the consensus sequence or consensus-like sequences with two to three amino acid substitutions  (Table 2) . However, the other two do not have the consensus motif. Recently, Smith et al.  [25]  reported that most of the methylated arginine residues were found in Arg-X amino acid-Arg (RXR) clusters in the C-terminus of PAB2. They showed both PRMT1 and PRMT3 methylated the arginine in the C- terminal domain. As shown in  Table 2 , ZF5 and p137GPI contained the RXR sequence, though the methylation sites of these proteins have not been identified yet.  

The glycine-rich clusters with many glycine–glycine dipeptides interspersed with aromatic or arginine residues are termed ‘‘RGG’’  [31] . The RGG motif is ubiquitous in proteins involved in diverse aspects of RNA metabolism such as pre-rRNA processing factors, pre-mRNA splicing factors, hnRNPs, and RNA helicases  [32] . The C-terminal RGG motif of hnRNP U, which lacks RRM (RNA recog- nition motif), facilitate as the RNA-binding motif  [31] . In nucleolin, which has two RRMs, the C-terminal RGG domain mediates RNA binding even without the RRMs [31] . However, Bouvet et al.  [33]  reported that this domain interacts with 10 ribosomal proteins. Likewise, in hnRNP A1, RGG domain is not only involved in interaction with RNA  [34]  but also with proteins  [35] . In spite of prevalence of RNA binding proteins with RGG motifs, few studies have directly addressed the effect of arginine methylation on binding of target proteins to RNA. However, recent studies have examined arginine methylation in modulating protein–

protein interactions (reviewed in  Ref. [36] ). Asymmetric arginine methylation of Sam68 within the RGG domains decreases Sam68 binding to SH3 proteins but not to WW domain-containing proteins, suggesting that methylation may alter the specific protein–protein contacts  [37] . Sim- ilarly, methylation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) decreases its affinity for its inhibitor PIAS1 [38] . Recently, we screened the factors that interact with the RGG domain of Npl3p with the two hybrid system and isolated nine different genes of which five have RGG domains  [39] .  

Disruption of Hmt1p/Rmt1p in yeast showed that the methyl transfer as e activity is critical for efficient nuclear transport of the specific hnRNP proteins, Npl3p, and Hrp1p, and is important in RNA metabolism  [40] . Npl3p is also modulated by phosphorylation in the arginine/serine (RS) domain by Sky1p and the phosphorylation influences the shuttling of Npl3p  [41,42] , indicating the complex regula- tion of hnRNP proteins with double modulation of arginine methylation and serine phosphorylation. In mammals, mouse embryonic stem cells bearing a null mutation of PRMT1 were viable, though the mouse was embryonic lethal  [15] . However, the yeast Hmt1p/Rmt1p deletion strain was viable under standard growth condition  [40] . In support of this, transfected HeLa cells with the VLD to AAA mutant, the dominant-negative PRMT1, expression vector survived and showed normal growth (unpublished data). Desrosiers and Tanguay  [43]  and Najbauer et al.  [44] reported that protein methylation is involved in cellular stress responses and the aging/repair of proteins. Consider- ing that PRMT1 is the predominant type I arginine methyl- ase in mammalian cells  [9] , PRMT1 may be required for specific developmental processes or for stress responses. Systematic screening of substrate proteins with the solid phase methylation reaction described here will contribute to identify new roles of PRMT family.
