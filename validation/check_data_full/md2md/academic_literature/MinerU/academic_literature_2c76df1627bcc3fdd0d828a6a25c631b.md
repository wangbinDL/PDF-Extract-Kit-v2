# INTRODUCTION  

Photorefractive Bi  $\mathrm{Bi}_{12}\mathrm{MO}_{20}$   (  $\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{S}\mathbf{i}$  , Ge, Ti) sillenites are promising materials for dynamic holography [1–6] and related applications owing to their fast photore- sponse. Bismuth titanate,   $\mathrm{Bi}_{12}\mathrm{TiO}_{20}$  , crystals offer the advantages of low optical rotation and high photosensi- tivity in the visible and near-IR spectral regions [1, 7]. Optical absorption has a signiﬁcant effect on the perfor- mance of photorefractive devices, and its temperature variation determines the temperature range of their nor- mal operation.  

Yet another salient feature of bismuth titanate is the signiﬁcant photoinduced absorption in the visible range [2, 8–15], which is believed to result from photoin- duced charge transfer between defect centers with dif- ferent photoionization cross sections [8–14]. The con- centration of such centers, the probabilities of the pho- toexcitation and thermal generation of nonequilibrium charge carriers and intracenter transitions, and recom- bination coefﬁcients govern the dynamics and magni- tude of photoinduced absorption [15] and may depend on temperature. The temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra of bismuth silicate and germanate crystals were studied in detail by Panchenko [16–18].  

The purpose of this work was to measure the tem- perature-dependent  absorption  coefﬁcient  of  $\mathrm{\bf\hat{B}i}_{12}\mathrm{\bf\hat{T}i O}_{20}\langle\hat{\mathrm{Ca}}\rangle$   in the red   $(6\bar{6}0\ \mathrm{nm})$  , yellow   $(570\ \mathrm{nm})$  ), and green   $(505~\mathrm{nm})$  ) spectral regions using the quasi- monochromatic output of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The temperature effect on the photoinduced absorption rise and decay kinetics was studied in the green spectral region.  

# EXPERIMENTAL  

In our experiments, we used a high-optical-quality

  $\mathrm{Bi}_{12}\mathrm{TiO}_{20}\langle\mathrm{Ca}\rangle$   single crystal  $5.9\,\mathrm{mm}$   in thickness (along

 [100]), prepared by top-seeded solution growth as described previously [19]. The (100) faces of the crys- tal,   $12\times12\:\mathrm{mm}$   mm in dimensions, were polished optically. The crystal was ﬁxed in a copper holder and mounted on a heater based on a thermoelectric Peltier element. The programmed temperature controller, built around an ADuC824 microcontroller, allowed the temperature to be maintained with an accuracy of  $\pm0.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The tem- perature was measured by a DS-1620 digital thermom- eter and continuously recorded on a computer. At room temperature (about   $23^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  C), the crystal temperature could be stabilized at  $5–110^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  

In measurements of the temperature-dependent absorption coefﬁcient   $\upalpha_{0}$   in the dark, the heating rate was  C/min. After heating to the set temperature, the sample was held isothermally for 5 min. Next, the sam- ple was illuminated for a short time (  $.1–2\;{\mathrm{s}}.$  , in order to minimize the photoinduced absorption). The measure- ments were made using a computer-interfaced system described elsewhere [15].  

All experiments were carried out without illumina- tion. Between the experiments, the crystal was stored in the dark for at least  $72\,\mathrm{h}$   to allow  $\upalpha_{0}$   relaxation. As light sources, we used LEDs operating at 660, 570, and  $505\;\mathrm{nm}$  .  

Photoinduced absorption kinetics were studied at  = 525 nm, an incident power density of   $3\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  , and temperatures of 23 and   $100^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  C. At both tempera-

tures, after pumping for 2400 s the beam was shut out, and the absorption decay was followed in the dark.

$505\,\mathrm{\nm}$   was found to be   ${\upalpha}_{\mathrm{R}_{0}}\,=\,0.15\,\mathrm{\cm}^{-1}$  ,   $\upalpha_{_{\mathrm{Y_{0}}}}=$   $0.74\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , and   $\upalpha_{\mathrm{G}_{0}}=4.06\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  , respectively. The tem- perature dependences of   $\Delta\upalpha(t)=\upalpha_{0}(t)-\upalpha_{0}(t_{0})$   at 660 and   $570\;\mathrm{nm}$   are shown in Fig. 1a, and those at   $505~\mathrm{nm}$  are shown in Fig. 1b. At the three wavelengths, the absorption coefﬁcient increases with temperature. With decreasing  $\uplambda$  , both   $\upalpha_{0}(t_{0})$   and   $\Delta\upalpha$   grow. The increase in absorption coefﬁcient upon an increase in temperature from 23 to   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C (  $(\Delta\upalpha_{\mathrm{R}}\,{=}\,0.018\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  ,   $\Delta\upalpha_{\mathrm{Y}}\,{=}\,0.24\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  ,  $\Delta\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathrm{G}}=1.65\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1})$  ) constitutes 12 to  $40\%$   of   $\upalpha_{0}(t_{0})$  .  

$\mathrm{Bi}_{12}\mathrm{TiO}_{20}\langle\mathrm{Ca}\rangle$   crystals are known to exhibit appre- ciable photoinduced absorption in the visible range, which was studied earlier at room temperature [19]. Figure 2 illustrates photoinduced absorption kinetics at 23 and   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C. The absorption is seen to rise more rap- idly at   $100^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  C (curve  2 ) compared to 23  $23^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  C (curve   $I$  ), but the saturation level at   $100^{\circ}\bar{\mathbf{C}}$  C is markedly lower.  

At   = 3000, 4200, and   $6000\,\mathrm{~s~}$  , the sample was pumped for a short time (1–2 s), and then the absorption

decay was analyzed. At   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,   $\Delta\upalpha$   dropped to zero in less than   $1800\,\mathrm{\dot{s}}$  ; at   $23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , a decrease in   $\Delta\upalpha$   to about  $0.75\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$   took   $5600\ \mathrm{s}$  . The photoinduced absorption rise curves obtained in the ﬁrst and second (  $\uptau=80\mathrm{00\,s}$  ) pump cycles differed very little.  

To gain more detailed insight into the photoinduced absorption decay, we carried out seven consecutive  $505{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{\hat{nm}}}$   pump cycles at   $100^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   (Fig. 3). After each cycle, long enough for the photoinduced absorption to achieve a steady-state level, the storage time in the dark was increased by a factor of 2. In this way, we obtained the photoinduced absorption decay curve displayed in Fig. 4. The decay curves obtained at 23 and   $\bar{100^{\circ}}\mathrm{C}$   are well represented by exponentials with decay times of 11700 and   $149\;\mathrm{s}.$  , respectively. Analysis of the photoin- duced absorption rise curves at short pump times (Figs. 2, 3) indicates a linear rise in absorption. The slope depends on the pump intensity and is   $1.5~\times$   $10^{-3}\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{(mW\;s)}$   at  $23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Increasing the temperature to  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   slightly increases the slope, to   $1.7\quad\times\quad$   $10^{-3}\:\mathrm{cm/(mW~s)}$  .  

# DISCUSSION  

In interpreting our results, we rely on the model described in [15], which assumes the presence of two defect species: a photoactive donor and trapping center. Either species has its own set of energy levels, and elec- tron transitions between donor centers and traps can be caused by photo- or thermal excitation. In this model, an increase in photoinduced absorption is due to the fact that the photoionization cross section of ﬁlled traps exceeds that of the donor. The reduction in the dark population of the donor and trap levels with increasing energy separation from the top of the valence band leads to a reduction in absorption with increasing wave- length.  

The increase in the absorption coefﬁcient with tem- perature, observed in the red, yellow, and green spectral regions, may be due to the ﬁlling of higher levels via intracenter transitions and to the higher probability of thermally induced electron transitions from donor cen- ters to traps. Long-term illumination gives rise to charge redistribution over the coupled systems of donor centers and traps owing to the electron photoexcitation to the conduction band and subsequent capture by ion- ized donors and empty traps, inﬂuencing the absorption coefﬁcient of the crystal in the visible range. The ﬁlling of traps with thermally excited electrons seems to be responsible for the decrease in  $\Delta\upalpha$   with increasing tem- perature.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

The photoinduced absorption in a Ca-doped bis- muth titanate crystal was measured as a function of temperature in the red   $(660\:\mathrm{nm})$  ), yellow   $(570\,\mathrm{nm})$  ), and green   $(505\;\mathrm{nm})$   spectral regions.  

The results demonstrate that, in the range   $^{23-}$   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the absorption coefﬁcient of the crystal rises with decreasing  $\uplambda$  . As the temperature is raised from 23 to   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the absorption coefﬁcient increases by 12 to  $40\%$   of the   $23^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   value:   $\Delta\upalpha_{\mathrm{R}}\,=\,0.018\,\mathrm{\cm^{-1}}$  ,   $\Delta\mathfrak{a}_{\mathrm{Y}}=$   $0.24\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  ,  $\Delta\upalpha_{\mathrm{G}}\,{=}\,1.65\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  . After 505-nm illumination, the absorption decay curves at 23 and   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   are well represented by exponentials with decay times of 11700 and   $149\;\mathrm{s}$  , respectively.
