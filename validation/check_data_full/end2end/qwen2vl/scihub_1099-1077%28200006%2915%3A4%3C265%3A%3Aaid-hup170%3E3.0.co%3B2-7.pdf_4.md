# NORADRENALINE AND COGNITIVE STRESSOR

## Table 2. Baseline clinical ratings and biochemical variables (mean ± SD)

|                    | Hamilton Depression Scale | Hamilton Anxiety Scale | Spielberger Trait | Plasma noradrenaline (pg/ml) | Plasma cortisol (nmol/l) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Melancholic/psychotic depression (n = 13) | 25.5 ± 6.3                | 20.8 ± 7.1             | 48.2 ± 12.5       | 302.0 ± 307.4               | 461.9 ± 151.1            |
| Non-melancholic Depression (n = 14)       | 23.5 ± 5.0                | 21.3 ± 5.6             | 55.4 ± 7.2        | 323.3 ± 327.3               | 394.7 ± 98.6             |
| Generalised anxiety disorder (n = 16)     | 16.4 ± 5.7                | 22.5 ± 8.8             | 56.4 ± 10.2       | 300.9 ± 261.4               | 405.5 ± 170.8            |
| Controls (n = 20)                          | —                         | —                      | 33.3 ± 5.2        | 221.3 ± 182.3               | 373.5 ± 109.9            |

## Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups.

### Biochemical, haemodynamic and subjective responses to the Stroop test

The data are reported as the maximum value obtained (peak) and the peak-baseline (P-B) for each group in Table 3. Although samples were taken to assess plasma NA on four occasions after the Stroop test, the peak response was usually at 3 min post test.

The P-B response was much reduced in the melancholic/psychotic group compared to the others. However, the Kruskal-Wallis test did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the four groups with respect to peak NA (H = 0.3, df = 3, p = 0.96) or P-B (H = 3.46, df = 3, p = 0.32).

### Table 3. Maximum and peak-baseline plasma noradrenaline (pg/ml) after Stroop test (mean ± SD)

|                    | Maximum plasma noradrenaline | Peak-baseline plasma noradrenaline |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Melancholic/psychotic depression (n = 13) | 366.1 ± 300.2                | 30.6 ± 99.9                       |
| Non-melancholic Depression (n = 14)       | 417.0 ± 444.5                | 125.1 ± 271.3                     |
| Generalised anxiety disorder (n = 16)     | 427.3 ± 375.2                | 126.3 ± 248.0                     |
| Controls (n = 20)                          | 431.2 ± 547.5                | 209.9 ± 580.0                     |
