## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

### Nisin resistance of the ΔlisK mutant.

Because deletion of the L. monocytogenes histidine kinase-encoding gene, lisK, results in an altered response to environmental parameters (5), we examined the susceptibility of L. monocytogenes to the lantibiotic nisin. It was found that the levels of nisin required to inhibit growth of wild-type LO28 are high relative to those required to inhibit the growth of a number of other gram-positive bacteria (9). This is a feature of this strain which we have previously observed in relation to other bacteriocins such as lactacin 3147 and enterocin A (our unpublished data). Growth curves were carried out to determine whether deletion of lisK affected the response to nisin. In the absence of nisin the growth rates of the parent and mutant strains were identical, but in the presence of increasing levels of nisin differences became apparent, primarily manifested as a significantly longer lag phase in wild-type LO28 (Fig. 1). This is most obvious when one observes that the lag period for LO28 in the presence of 300 μg of nisin/ml is 6 h longer than that for LO28ΔlisK (Fig. 1E). There is no difference in the growth rates once the lag phase has been exited (e.g., both are 0.046 U/h during logarithmic growth in the presence of 200 μg of nisin/ml). Therefore, the LisK mutation results in a culture that is able to rapidly initiate growth in the presence of nisin, whereas the parent apparently needs a significant period in which to adapt to the presence of the inhibitor. We speculate that, during prior growth in the absence of nisin, the LisRK system plays a role in creating a particular cell envelope composition that renders the cell more susceptible to nisin (and also alters its
