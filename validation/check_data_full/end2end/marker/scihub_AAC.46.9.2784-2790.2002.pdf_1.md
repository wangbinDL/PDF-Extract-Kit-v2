Growth in the presence of nisin. The rates of growth of L. monocytogenes LO28 and LO28AlisK in the presence of different levels of nisin (2% inoculum in TSB-YE containing 50, 100, 150, 200, or 300 µg of nisin powder [Sigma, St.

Louis, Mo.]/ml) were compared by monitoring optical density at 600 nm (OD600)
with a Spectra Max 340 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) over a 20-h period.

Antibiotic assays. Assays to determine the sensitivities of LO28 and LO28AlisK to a wide range of antibiotics were carried out by agar diffusion. Overnight cultures were diluted to 106 CFU/ml and swabbed onto TSA-YE.

Commercially purchased disks (6 mm in diameter; Oxoid) containing 30 µg (unless otherwise stated) of the antibiotics to be studied were then placed on the surfaces of agar plates. Following overnight incubation of the plates at 37°C, the diameters of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition surrounding the filter disks were measured. The relative susceptibilities of different strains to the various antibiotics tested were correlated with the sizes of the zones of inhibition, with increased zone size reflecting increased susceptibility. Initially the antibiotics assayed were cefotaxime, cefuroxime, vancomycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, fosfomycin (50 µg), minocycline, polymyxin B (300 µg), streptomycin (25 µg),
fusidic acid (10 ug), oxytetracycline, penicillin (10 ug), clindamycin (10 µg), spectinomycin (25 µg), ampicillin (25 µg), novobiocin, rifampin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, colistin sulfate (25 µg), chloramphenicol (CAM), and tetracycline.

In addition to this assay, designed to compare antibiotic susceptibilities in general, further studies involved disks containing antibiotics of the cephalosporin family. These were cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefaclor, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefotetan, cefoperazone, cephradine, cephalexin, and cefotaxime (all 30 µg).

Implementation of the nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system in L. monocytogenes LO28AlisK. A strategy to replace the hemolysin gene, hly, on the L.

monocytogenes chromosome with the nisRK genes was devised. Primers were designed to amplify the chromosomal regions flanking the hly gene (primers HSOEA, -B, -C, and -D; Table 1). The resultant A-B and C-D fragments were spliced by overlap extension PCR (19) using primers HSOEA and -D to create a single A-D fragment, representing the region surrounding hly but with the gene precisely removed. This fragment was subsequently cloned in temperature-sensitive plasmid pKSV7 (41). Since primers B and C have built-in restriction sites, we were able to clone the nisRK operon (amplified, by using primers nisRF and nisKB, from pNZ9530 [21]) into the location formerly occupied by hly. This

plasmid construct, pCPL-53, was electroporated into L. monocytogenes LO28AlisK, and transformants were selected on BHI agar with 10 µg of CAM/ml
(BHI/CAM). Chromosomal integration of the plasmid at 41℃ was selected by serial passage of a transformant in prewarmed BHI/CAM broth and streaking onto prewarmed BHI/CAM agar. Plasmid excision was accomplished by continuous passage in BHI at 30℃, and clones in which nisRK had replaced hly on the chromosome were identified by plating them onto blood agar plates at 30℃. Replica plating of nonhemolytic colonies onto BHI and BHI/CAM at 30°C identified cured derivatives. PCR and sequencing analysis of one such strain confirmed that the nisRK operon had replaced the hly gene. This strain was designated LO28AlisK-NICE.

Overexpression of lisR. PCR primers NZlisRF (containing the lisR start codon) and NZlisRB (containing the lisR stop codon) with incorporated NcoI and XbaI sites, respectively, were used to amplify lisR from LO28. The resultant PCR product was digested with NcoI and XbaI restriction enzymes (Roche) and cloned into similarly digested pNZ8048, resulting in the generation of a translational fusion between the nisin-inducible nisA promoter on pNZ8048 and the lisR gene. This event was confirmed by sequence analysis. This strain was designated LO28ΔlisK-NICE(pNZ8048-lisR). pNZ8048 was also introduced into the LO28AlisK-NICE background to create LO28AlisK-NICE(pNZ8048). As an alternative to inducible overexpression, lisR (amplified by primer pair NZlisRF and NZlisRB) was also cloned into plasmid pNZ44, a derivative of pNZ8048 in which the Pnis promoter was replaced by a constitutive P44 promoter (29),
resulting in the creation of LO28AlisK(pNZ44-lisR). LO28ΔlisK(pNZ44) was also created to serve as a control for subsequent experiments.

RT-PCR. RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were carried out as described previously (6). RNA was isolated from overnight cultures
(constitutive overexpression system) or following nisin induction (inducible overexpression system). For induction with nisin cultures were grown to an OD600 of 0.2 and preinduced with 4.5 µg of nisin powder/ml for 1 h, followed by induction with 45 µg of nisin powder/ml (a concentration at which there is no difference in the nisin sensitivities of the two strains) for 30 min and then isolation of RNA. In all cases cDNA was amplified by PCR with specific primers and samples were taken at regular intervals and run on agarose gels. Primers for the 16S rRNA of L. monocytogenes LO28 were used as controls (36).

Because deletion of the L. monocytogenes histidine kinase-encoding gene, lisK, results in an altered response to environmental parameters (5), we examined the susceptibility of L. monocytogenes to the lantibiotic nisin. It was found that the levels of nisin required to inhibit growth of wild-type LO28 are high relative to those required to inhibit the growth of a number of other grampositive bacteria (9). This is a feature of this strain which we have previously observed in relation to other bacteriocins such as lacticin 3147 and enterocin A (our unpublished data).

Growth curves were carried out to determine whether deletion of lisK affected the response to nisin. In the absence of nisin the growth rates of the parent and mutant strains were identical, but in the presence of increasing levels of nisin differences became apparent, primarily manifested as a significantly longer lag phase in wild-type LO28 (Fig. 1). This is most obvious when one observes that the lag period for LO28 in the presence of 300 ug of nisin/ml is 6 h longer than that for LO28AlisK (Fig.

1E). There is no difference in the growth rates once the lag phase has been exited (e.g., both are 0.046 U/h during logarithmic growth in the presence of 200 ug of nisin/ml). Therefore, the LisK mutation results in a culture that is able to rapidly initiate growth in the presence of nisin, whereas the parent apparently needs a significant period in which to adapt to the presence of the inhibitor. We speculate that, during prior growth in the absence of nisin, the LisRK system plays a role in creating a particular cell envelope composition that renders the cell more susceptible to nisin (and also alters its INU ANOZIAA NAヨHTAON yd
