# Electrocyclic Reactions

Electrocyclic reactions are intramolecular reactions that are ring closing (form a sigma bond) or ring opening (break a sigma bond). The key sigma bond, either formed or broken, must be at the terminus of a pi system so that either the product or reactant must be a fully conjugated diene, triene, etc. These reactions are classified by the number of pi electrons involved and are illustrated below with the key sigma bond highlighted in magenta.

4 π Electrocyclic Reaction

Electrocyclic reactions happen from the HOMO of the molecule and differ in their outcomes based on orbital rotation for the forming/breaking sigma bond. If the orbitals involved rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counterclockwise), the process is called corotatory. If the orbitals involved rotate in opposite directions (one clockwise and one counterclockwise), the process is called disrotatory. These differences in rotation are critically important when stereocenters are formed or broken.

As illustrated below, treatment of the substituted hexatriene shows yield of each cis product when heated but the trans product when treated with light. This can be explained by the rotation of the HOMO psi 4 which rotates in a disrotatory fashion to yield the cis pi product while the trans product is formed under irradiation due to the corotatory motion of the HOMO psi 4.

We will delve deeper into this analysis in a subsequent chapter. In general, electrocyclic reactions behave according to the generalized rules outlined below.
