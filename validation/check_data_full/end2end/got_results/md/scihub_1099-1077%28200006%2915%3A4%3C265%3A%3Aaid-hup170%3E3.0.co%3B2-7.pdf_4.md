Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups.
Biochemical, haemodynamic and subjective responses to the Stroop test
The data are reported as the maximum value obtained (peak) and the peak-baseline (P-B) for each group in Table 3. Although samples were taken to assess plasma NA on four occasions after the Stroop test, the peak response was usually at 3 min post test.
The P-B response was much reduced in the melancholic/psychotic group compared to the others. However, the Kruskal-Wallis test did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the four groups with respect to peak NA \((H=0 \cdot 3, d f=3, p=0 \cdot 96)\) or \(\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{B}(H=3 \cdot 46\), \(d f=3, p=0 \cdot 32)\).
For all subjects, plasma NA values were summed after the stress testing \((+3,+10,+20,+30\) min), to give an indicator of sustained plasma NA values after the Stroop. There was no statistically significant difference between the four groups for the summated plasma NA value \((H=0 \cdot 25, d f=3\), \(p=0 \cdot 97)\). There was no statistically significant difference in peak NA and P-B response between males and females, for the total group or depressed patients.
The maximum values for pulse and blood pressure are given in Table 4 by group. Because of technical problems not all patients had automated haemodynamic measurements. There was no statistically significant difference in pulse between the four groups. There was a strong trend for a significant difference with respect to maximum systolic blood pressure \((H=7 \cdot 1, d f=3, p=0 \cdot 07)\) and maximum diastolic blood pressure \((H=7 \cdot 4\),
