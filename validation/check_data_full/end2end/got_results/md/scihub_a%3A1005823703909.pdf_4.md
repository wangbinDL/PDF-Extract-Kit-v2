grams), and so the precipitating factor is uncertain. This patient received another cycle of amonafide without complication.
The other cardiac event occurred after cycle 5 of anomafide in a patient with no previous cardiac history. The patient developed hypotension. The electrocardiogram revealed new \(\mathrm{T}\) wave inversions in all leads. The nuclear ejection fraction was normal at \(74 \%\) and the cardiac enzymes were normal. The echocardiogram revealed a very small pericardial effusion, an atrial septal aneurysm and normal wall motion. The patient received no further treatment with amonafide. As there was no other obvious precipitating factor, this event makes a significant difference.
Headache occurred in \(20 \%\) (6 patients) of those entered: grade I or II (mild to moderate and transient) in 5 patients and as grade III (severe and unrelenting) in the sixth patient. The grade I/III headaches were generally brief and relieved with analgesics, however, one patient did have grade II headaches intermittently for one month following treatment. The one patient with a grade III headache developed it just prior to administration of the fifth dose in cycle 5 . The headache lasted 5 days. A head CT revealed only mastoiditis. No further chemotherapy was given as the patient progressed and developed cardiac toxicity as described above.
Only one patient developed grade III nausea. Constitutional occurs required in only one patient during a period of grade IV leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
Transient elevation of liver function tests occurred in 9 patients and consisted mostly of mild transaminase elevations. One patient developed grade II transaminase elevations transient 2 weeks after therapy and did not increase grade V elevation of birthborn on one month after treatment. Sonogram of the liver revealed only fatty changes.
\section*{Pharmacokinetic results}
Using caffeine as a substrate, it has previously been demonstrated that the ratio of urinary concentration of two metabolites of caffeine 5-acetylamino-6-amino-3methylaracil (AAMU) and 1-methylxanthine (1X) is a useful discriminator of acetylator phenotype .
Acetylator phenotyping was available in 21 of the 30 patients on the study. AAMU/1X ratios ranged from 0.03 to 11.6 with a median of 1.31 and a 75th percentile of 1.76. A molar ratio of AAMU/1X of 1.8 was used to distinguish fast and slow acetylators  (see Fig. 2). By this criterion, 4 of the 21 patients (19\%, \(90 \%\) confidence interval \(7 \%-38 \%\) ) were characterized as fast acetylators. Leukocyte nadirs were available for \(18 / 21\) patients for whom acetylator phenotyping was available, including 15 of the 17 slow acetylators  (see Fig. 2). The mean value of 12 patients was \(12.1 \%\), 12.1\% and 12.1\% for 12.1\% for 12.1\% for 12,1\% for 12.1\% for 12.1\% in 12.1\% for 12.1\% for 12\% for 12.1\% for 12.1\% for \(12.1 \%\) for 12.1\% for 12.1\% for 13.1\% for 13.1\% for 13.1\%
