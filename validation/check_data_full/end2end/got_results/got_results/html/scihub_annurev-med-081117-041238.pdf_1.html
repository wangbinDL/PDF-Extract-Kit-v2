"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, affecting \\\\ 1:5,000 males and 1:6,000 females worldwide (1). FXS is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the \\\\ promoter region of fragile \\(\\mathrm{X}\\) mental retardation gene, FMR1. More than 200 repeats of CGG lead \\\\ to hypermethylation and silencing of the gene, causing the loss of fragile \\(\\mathrm{X}\\) mental retardation \\\\ protein (FMRP). In \\(<1 \\%\\) of FXS individuals, absence of FMRP is caused by mutations in the \\\\ coding region of FMR1 (1). Males with FXS display intellectual disability (IQ ranging between \\\\ 20 and 70) and a broad spectrum of symptoms including physical abnormalities (macroorchidism, \\\\ prominent ears, elongated face and hyperextensible finger joints), and behavioral (anxiety, social \\\\ avoidance and hand clapping), cognitive (executive functioning, visual-spatial processing and de- \\\\ developmental delay), and neurological (epilepsy and disrupted sleep patterns) deficits (Table 1). \\\\ Because the disease is X-linked, females with a full mutation are less affected than males, with an \\\\ average IQ of 75-80 (1). Several animal models of FXS have been developed, including Drosophila, \\\\ mouse, and rat (Table 1; see sidebar titled Animal Models of Fragile X Syndrome for details). In \\\\ recent years, numerous preclinical and clinical studies have been carried out to develop and test \\\\ novel therapeutics for FXS (2). In this review, we describe the latest advances in understanding \\\\ the molecular basis of the disease pathogenesis and highlight the emerging therapeutic potential \\\\ of the antidiabetic drug metformin.\n"+

"Many neuropsychiatric symptoms of FXS are thought to be a consequence of dysregulated protein synthesis at the synapse (3). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein, targeting a subpopulation of neuronal mRNAs \\((1,4)\\). The cardinal function of FMRP is repression of translation, mainly of genes encoding synaptic plasticity-related proteins \\((1,4)\\). The absence of FMRP leads to\n"+
