"Biochemical, haemodynamic and subjective responses to the Stroop test\n"+
"The data are reported as the maximum value obtained (peak) and the peak-baseline (P-B) for each group in Table 3. Although samples were taken to assess plasma NA on four occasions after the Stroop test, the peak response was usually at 3 min post test.\n"+
"The P-B response was much reduced in the melancholic/psychotic group compared to the others. However, the Kruskal-Wallis test did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the four groups with respect to peak NA \\((H=0 \\cdot 3, d f=3, p=0 \\cdot 96)\\) or \\(\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{B}(H=3 \\cdot 46\\), \\(d f=3, p=0 \\cdot 32)\\).\n"+
"For all subjects, plasma NA values were summed after the stress testing \\((+3,+10,+20,+30\\) min), to give an indicator of sustained plasma NA values after the Stroop. There was no statistically significant difference between the four groups for the summated plasma NA value \\((H=0 \\cdot 25, d f=3\\), \\(p=0 \\cdot 97)\\). There was no statistically significant difference in peak NA and P-B response between males and females, for the total group or depressed patients.\n"+
"The maximum values for pulse and blood pressure are given in Table 4 by group. Because of technical problems not all patients had automated haemodynamic measurements. There was no statistically significant difference in pulse between the four groups. There was a strong trend for a significant difference with respect to maximum systolic blood pressure \\((H=7 \\cdot 1, d f=3, p=0 \\cdot 07)\\) and maximum diastolic blood pressure \\((H=7 \\cdot 4\\),\n"+
