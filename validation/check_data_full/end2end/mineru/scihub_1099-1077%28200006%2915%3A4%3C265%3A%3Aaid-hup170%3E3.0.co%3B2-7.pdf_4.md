Table 1[ There were no statistically signi_cant di}erences between groups[  

The data are reported as the maximum value obtained "peak# and the peak baseline "PÐB# for each group in Table 2[ Although samples were taken to assess plasma NA on four occasions after the Stroop test\ the peak response was usually at 2 min post test[  

The PÐB response was much reduced in the mel! ancholic:psychotic group compared to the others[ However\ the Kruskal!Wallis test did not dem! onstrate any statistically signi_cant di}erence between the four groups with respect to peak NA  $(H=0{\cdot}3,\;\;d f\!=3,\bar{\;\;}p=\bar{0}{\cdot}96)$   or   $\mathrm{P}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{B}$     ${\cal H}=3{\cdot}46$  \  $d f\!=3$  \  $p=0{\cdot}32)$  #[  

For all subjects\ plasma NA values were sum! mated after the stress testing  $(+3,\,+10,\,+20,\,+30$  min#\ to give an indicator of sustained plasma NA values after the Stroop[ There was no statistically signi_cant di}erence between the four groups for the summated plasma NA value   ${\it(H=0{\cdot}25\}$  \    $d f=3$  \  $p=0{\cdot}97$  #[ There was no statistically signi_cant di}erence in peak NA and   $\mathrm{P}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{B}$   response between males and females\ for the total group or depressed patients alone[  

The maximum values for pulse and blood pres! sure are given in Table 3 by group[ Because of technical problems not all patients had automated ha emo dynamic measurements[ There was no stat! istically signi_cant di}erence in pulse between the four groups[ There was a strong trend for a sig! ni_cant di}erence with respect to maximum systolic blood pressure   $(H=7{\cdot}1\bar{,}\;\;d f\!=3,\;\,p=0{\cdot}0\bar{7})$   and maximum diastolic blood pressure "  $H=7{\cdot}4$  \
