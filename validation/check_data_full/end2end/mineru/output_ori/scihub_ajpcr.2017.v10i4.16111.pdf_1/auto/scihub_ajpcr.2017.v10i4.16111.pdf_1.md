1. Neonates not receiving any medications other than  fluids/ electrolyte solution, parenteral nutrition, nutritional supplements,  blood and blood products, oxygen, photo therapy, and vaccinations.

 2.	 Neonates admitted to NICU for mother sake.  

•  Data were recorded in pre designed performa for the study;  prescriptions were evaluated for profile name, education and  occupation of parents, diagnosis, birth weight, gestation al age,  congenital anomalies, and time of admission after birth.

 •  The name, formulation drug, route of drugs administration, generic  and brand name, drugs, and from essential drug list.  

Data were analyzed by Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and using descriptive  statistics. Results were depicted in the form of percentages and graphs.  A total of 220 prescriptions were scrutinized, over a period of 6 months  from April 2014 to September 2014, on the basis of inclusion and  exclusion criteria.  

Data show that male neonates   $(53.6\%]$  ), outnumbered female neonates   $(46.4\%)$   (Fig. 1).  

A total of drugs prescribed 808 and drugs were prescribed in the range  of 1-6, that is minimum 1 to maximum 6 drugs per prescription. The  average number of drugs per prescription was 3.6. The most frequently  prescribed therapeutic class of drugs antimicrobial agents   $(60.64\%)$  followed by vitamin K   $(26.7\%)$   and amino ph yl line   $(9.4\%)$   (Table 1).  Most of the antimicrobial s prescribed belonged to amino glycosides  group (gentamycin), followed by cephalosporin (cefotaxime) and  carbapenem (meropenem) and all these drugs are given by parenteral  route.  

The drugs are prescribed by branded name outnumbered than a  generic name. The maximum number   $(50\%)$   of neonate was born with  birth weight   $<\!2.5$   (Table 2). The maximum number   $(42\%)$   of neonate  was born at 34-36 weeks of gestation (Fig. 2). The common neonatal  conditions are preterm LBW   $(39\%)$  , neonatal sepsis   $(24\%)$  , birth  asphyxia   $(11\%)$  , meningitis  $(6\%)$  , and others   $(20\%)$  .  

Few number of neonates received broncho dial tors, anti epileptic drugs,  and micro nutrient compounds.  

Drug utilization studies are the tools helps both prescribing physicians  and the hospital administration regarding drug audit, and drug  expenditure. Furthermore, helps in cost analysis which is an important  parameter to decide whether it is a rational or not drug therapy. It is  also helpful in framing hospital formulary and standard treatment  guidelines as per the diagnosis. These studies not only guide for the  rational use of drugs but are also helpful in making treatment costeffective and beneficial to patients and reduce the burden of poorly  funded health system in developing countries like India [7-9].  

In this study, the average number of drugs per encounter were 3.6  consistent with study of Brijal  et al.  $(4.4\%)$  of drugs per prescription should always be kept low as it can lead to  increase in unnecessary cost of treatment, higher possibility of drugdrug interaction, and also increase the risk of adverse drug reactions  and antibiotic resistance.  

Demographic profile shows male   $\left(54.3\%\right)$   preponderance in  neonates attending the NICU consistent with study of Brijal  et al. 2015    $(60\%)$  health-care is apparent in the study. There is an immediate need to  create awareness against gender discrimination which begins at the  early age.  

Findings were reported by majority (80.8) of the neonates were under  7 days of age, indicating that most of neonatal diseases are  common in early neonatal age. This is in accordance with study  conducted by Junejo  et al.  [10,11] in which patients admitted in  the early neonatal period were   $83.4\%$  . A neonate is particularly  vulnerable to adverse influences such as asphyxia, infection, and  complications of preterm birth.  During early neonatal days (7)  and requires special attention. Parenteral  route is commonly seen  in NICU and it plays crucial role in the management of sick neonates  until they can tolerate enteral/oral feeding.
