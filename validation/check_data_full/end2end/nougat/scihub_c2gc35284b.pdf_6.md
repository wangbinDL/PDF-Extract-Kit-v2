bearing electron-withdrawing groups (Table 1, entry 4) afforded a better yield than those bearing electron-donating groups (Table 1, entries 2 and 3) when 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst was used, however, the employment of 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3 (Table 1, entry 17 vs. 16) and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 (Table 1, entry 22 vs. 21) gave the opposite results. The A\({}^{3}\) coupling reaction was reported to be highly affected by the nature of aldehydes, and the reactivity of aldehydes could be affected by the employed catalyst.[4; 6; 14; 22; 29] Kidwai _et al._ found that aryl aldehydes possessing electron-withdrawing groups afforded a better yield than that with an electron-donating group bound to the benzene ring which required longer reaction time with metallic Au nanoparticles as catalyst.[11] Wei and Li reported that both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were able to undergo the corresponding A\({}^{3}\) coupling with the catalyst of AuBr\({}_{3}\).[4] They found that electron-withdrawing groups displayed high reactivities, however, electron-rich groups bound to the benzene ring decreased the reactivity and required a longer reaction time. The decreased yield for aliphatic aldehydes was caused by the trimerization of aliphatic aldehydes with homogeneous gold salts. Zhang and Corma found that benzaldehyde with electron-donating groups react smoothly, while substitution of electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring decreases the reactivity with the catalyst of Au/CeO\({}_{2}\).[14] Based on the above results, we may presume that the activity difference could be due to the different properties (_e.g._, different oxidation states) between 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 and 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts.

With the catalyst of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, the reaction with secondary amines proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding propargylamines (Table 1, entries 1, 7-9). Among the various amines tested, alicyclic amines such as piperidine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine gave good conversions of benzaldehyde, whereas the diethylamine afforded a lower conversion. This was probably due to the minimum ions generated from alicyclic amines and benzaldehyde which are more stable than that generated from dialkyl amine and benzaldehyde.

A variety of aromatic alkynes were coupled with benzaldehyde and piperidine in the presence of the 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst. It was found that straight-chain alkyl substituted phenylacetylene showed decreasing conversion of benzaldehyde with increasing chain length, the conversions were 86.4%, 70.6%, and 28.5% for methyl, ethyl, and butyl phenylacetylene, respectively (Table 1, entries 10-12). Clearly, when increasing the steric hindrance of alkynes, it gave a decrease in conversion. The reaction was found to be highly affected by the steric hindrance of the alkynes, which was probably ascribed to the limitation effect of the IRMOF-3 channels. Aliphatic alkynes such as 1-octyne and (trimethylsilyl)acetylene also afforded moderate conversions of benzaldehyde with 62.1% and 56.6%, respectively (Table 1, entries 13 and 14).

The reusability studies of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 were carried out on the A\({}^{3}\) coupling reaction of benzaldehyde, piperidine, and phenylacetylene. The results are summarized in Table 2. The fresh 4.6%Au/
