Table 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups.

Biochemical, haemodynamic and subjective responses to the Stroop test The data are reported as the maximum value obtained (peak) and the peak-baseline (P-B) for each group in Table 3. Although samples were taken to assess plasma NA on four occasions after the Stroop test, the peak response was usually at 3 min post test.

The P-B response was much reduced in the melancholic/psychotic group compared to the others.

However, the Kruskal-Wallis test did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference between the four groups with respect to peak NA
(H = 0-3, df = 3, p = 0.96) or P-B (H = 3.46, df = 3, p = 0.32).

For all subjects, plasma NA values were summated after the stress testing (+3, +10, +20, +30 min), to give an indicator of sustained plasma NA
values after the Stroop. There was no statistically significant difference between the four groups for the summated plasma NA value (H = 0.25, df = 3, p = 0.97). There was no statistically significant difference in peak NA and P-B response between males and females, for the total group or depressed patients alone.

The maximum values for pulse and blood pressure are given in Table 4 by group. Because of technical problems not all patients had automated haemodynamic measurements. There was no statistically significant difference in pulse between the four groups. There was a strong trend for a significant difference with respect to maximum systolic blood pressure (H = 7-1, df = 3, p = 0-07) and maximum diastolic blood pressure (H = 7.4,
